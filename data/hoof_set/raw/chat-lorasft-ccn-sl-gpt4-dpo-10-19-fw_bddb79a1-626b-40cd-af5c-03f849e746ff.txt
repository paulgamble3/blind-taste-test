Patient: Yes. I can.
Nurse: Great, I'm glad to hear that.Just a heads up, you'll need to arrive 30 minutes earlier at 7Can you make it at that time?
Patient: Sure.
Nurse: Okay, good.I also want to remind you that your arrival location is on the 1st Floor Pre-op Suite at 1111 Parnassus Ave in San Francisco.Does that sound okay to you?
Patient: It does.
Nurse: Great.I know that a colonoscopy can be a bit intimidating, but rest assured that our team is highly experienced and will make sure you're comfortable throughout the procedure.If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.

Nurse: Alright, if you do think of any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call us.We're here to make this process as smooth as possible for you.
Patient: Thank you
Nurse: You're welcome!It's important to us that you feel prepared and informed.If anything else comes up, don't hesitate to reach out.
Patient: Okay.
Nurse: Great, I'm glad you're feeling prepared.Just one more thing, have you arranged for a ride home after the procedure?
Patient: No. I haven't.Been able to find one.
Nurse: I understand, it's important to have someone to take you home after the procedure because you'll be sedated.Let me look into some options for you and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Patient: Sounds good.
Nurse: Great, I'll get on that right away.In the meantime, I want to go over some diet changes with you.Starting today, you should begin a clear liquid diet.This means no solid foods and also no alcohol or marijuana.Have you started on this diet and do you understand why it's important?
Patient: I've started on the dietAnd, honestly, no, I don'tunderstandWhy I can'teat animals.
Nurse: I understand your concern.The reason we have you on a clear liquid diet is to ensure your colon is completely clean for the colonoscopy.Solid foods and alcohol or marijuana can leave residue in the colon which can make it difficult for the doctor to get a clear view during the procedure.Does that make sense?
Patient: It doesn't, but I'll take your word for it.
Nurse: I appreciate your understanding.Now, let's talk about the bowel prep for your colonoscopy.You'll need to begin drinking the prep solution the evening before the procedure.You should drink 8 ounces of the solution every 10 to 15 minutes until it's finished.You'll then be able to go to bed.In the morning, you'll finish the remaining solution.Do you have your prep solution with you and do you understand these instructions?
Patient: I have it, and I do understand.
Nurse: Great, it sounds like you're well-prepared for your colonoscopy.I just need to ask, do you currently have a fever or any viral illness such as the flu, COVID, RSV, or shingles?
Patient: No. I don't.
Nurse: Great, that's good to hear.I'm glad you're feeling well for your procedure.If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask.
Patient: I do have a question, but it's not about theprocedure.
Nurse: Of course, I'll do my best to help with any questions you have.What's your question?
Patient: I wanted to find out what the address of the nearest Starbucksto the hospital is.
Nurse: I can certainly help you with that.The nearest Starbucks to our hospital is located at 401 Parnassus Avenue.It's just a short walk away.I hope that helps!
Patient: It does help. Thank you very much.
