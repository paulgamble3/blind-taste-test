Nurse: Good morning. This is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help
Patient: You? Cara. Yeah, this is Tony LFO. Um, I sent a up to date, uh, medication list over the weekend. I don't know. Hopefully I got it. Ok. And let
Nurse: Me take a look here and just getting you pulled up. Ok. I don't believe I did. It could have gone to a different staff bucket as well. Um, but you said it via my chart.
Patient: Yes, I put it into that Mychart thing. I deleted all the ones we were no longer taking. They just left the supposed, I did even print the updated list off of that list, so.
Nurse: Ok. Ok. All right. Um, yeah, it could have just gone to a different staff bucket but it'll get reviewed. Um, do you need any refills on anything right now?
Patient: Well, yeah. Well, Express scripts been trying to refill two of them. Of course, they have been, uh, they haven't done it. So, uh, that's why I did it in the first place, so. Ok. Ok. I'll, I can tell you what the two are I believe. Yeah. Let me know what Zoil or Cze or Plavix, I guess.
Nurse: Oh, the. Ok. Yep. The clopidogrel. Uh huh. The 75. And you take that once a day.
Patient: Yeah, I take that's one of the ones I continue taking and then the, the hell, where the hell did I go? Mhm. Can't find it. So, Fifield Slider Field Cider film.
Nurse: The 100 mg tablets.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. They tried filling that one. Of course they wouldn't do it because one of those pills I was taking had nitroglycerin in it.
Nurse: Yes. Ok. Um, I do have a recent note. It looks like [PHI-Personal] spoke with you in regards to that and taking it
Patient: With the.
Nurse: Ok. Um, so the Sildenafil and the Isorbide have a drug interaction.
Patient: Which one is that? No, I don't take any of them. I'm going to tell you which ones I take. Ok. Ok. And these are from uh through doctor uh pri the heart doctor. Ok. Ok. The first one I take is the Entresto. Uh huh. The 25 MG or whatever that is um, one tablet a day. No, no, one tablet, two times a day. I'm sorry? Ok. Yep. Ok. Or whatever it is. 50 mg. Mhm. Ah, this is supposed to be taken two times a day also. There's no refills on it. So. Ok. The other one I'm taking is that or whatever it is. The Plavix once a day. Ok. Oh, the 80 mg or whatever? Uh huh. Yep. Once a day. Of course, the other one and the other ones I take are just multivitamins, the glucosamine. Yeah. Ok. The multivitamin and then I,
Nurse: All right. Got you. Yeah. So I clicked in a little bit further into your chart and I do see where you had flagged a bunch of those lists or the other medications to be removed. So, um, I do see all of those changes right now that medication list is pending for review with the doctor, um, on those changes. So I will send a message over to doctor [PHI-Personal] clarifying that you're no longer taking that one that has the contraindication um with the Sildenafil and see if we can get those two medications refilled. You said you need the Sildenafil and then the Plavix both to the Express scripts,
Patient: Correct? Yes, I do. They all go through Express scripts.
Nurse: Ok, perfect. Um And then you did say the metoprolol doesn't have any refills either.
Patient: Uh No, no, I guess I'm going to have to get that from doctor S ok. Ok. So I guess it must be through him or wherever it started from the hospital or I'm not sure.
Nurse: Yeah. Ok. It
Patient: Doesn't, it says no refills on it. Uh see uh somewhere here. Yeah, that Entresto can't be refilled. Ok.
Nurse: Yeah. The metoprolol tartrate. So yeah, the Entresto and then the metoprolol tartrate. Those two can probably those probably need to come from your cardiologist. Um So just reach out to them to get those refills
Patient: Working. I got to see him next Monday. So.
Nurse: Ok, perfect. All right. So we can get those through them and then I'll request the Plavix and the uh Sildenafil. Ok.
Patient: Ok. Thank you.
Nurse: All right. Yes, sir. If there's any other issue or changes, we'll let you know. Um, do you have a recent BP reading? Do you check that at home often?
Patient: Yeah, I've been, well he his heart doctor once it's done every day, twice a day. Ok. So, yeah, I did it a little while ago if you want. I can tell you. Yeah. Yeah. Hang on.

Patient: This morning. Let me go. Look, the weight was 1 60. Ok. I usually take it in the morning. So, yeah. Perfect. Ok. Oh, I didn't write it down. What a dummy, I wrote everything but the, the thing, hm. Let me see if I can recall. No, I don't know. No. 1 [PHI-Account]/56.
Nurse: Ok. Ok. So, yeah, based on those readings, I'm glad to hear that you aren't taking those additional, uh, medications cause that would definitely make it a lot lower. Um, and you're already getting some of those, the diastolic, the bottom number that are lower than the fifties. Um, do you ever experience any sort of like dizziness or lightheadedness or fatigue feelings at all?
Patient: Well, yeah, uh, the fatigue part I'll get, uh, but, yeah, I've been trying to walk more so, uh, I've been trying to do like, [PHI-Account] laps around the pool. Yeah. And I don't feel a little out of winded, a little short of breath, you know. Ok. And I have to take a break but I don't know how, how many, how far it is around that pool. Not that far, but it's far enough. So, for me, since I haven't done anything for over a month. Yeah, it's a little bit of a, uh, a work out for me right now. But, yeah. Uh, yeah, that's the only time I'll feel it as, uh, I'll feel short winded after the [PHI-Account] or 15 laps around the pool.
Nurse: Ok. Ok. All right. Um,
Patient: All right. I'm sorry?
Nurse: Oh, no, no, you're fine. Um, I'm just jotting down notes. So, uh, just, it's good that you have your appointment coming up on Monday, you said right? For the cardiologist.
Patient: Next, next, next. Yeah. Yep. This one, I just have to drop off that list. Ok. All right. Got it. Sorry. Today is, today is not Monday. Today is Tuesday.
Nurse: Yeah, we're all, we're all mixed up with the holiday. Um, ok. So, yeah, so drop off that list, they'll review those blood pressures. I'm sure they'll give you a call if there's any concern or medication changes. Um, some of those numbers are a little bit lower but we'll leave it to the cardiologist to kind of adjust that dose. Um and then I will put in the request on these refills for doctor in the meantime. Ok. All right. Yes, sir. And I'll call you as soon as I have any sort of update from them. Ok. Ok. Thank you. Uh huh. You take care. Bye
Patient: Now. Bye bye.
