Um I kinda described to her, you know what vaccines you were gonna need with the yellow fever and tetanus shot and all that good stuff. Um She says sadly they do not carry those in the office. Those would be more available at the health department or travel medicine clinic. And I actually have the information of um passport Health, which is a travel clinic. So basically they do all the common vaccines and yellow fever vaccines and vaccines for folks that are going out of the country. And there's three locations in [PHI-Geographic]. Ok. Where, where
