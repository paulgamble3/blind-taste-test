Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. Hi,
Patient: [PHI-Personal]. This is [PHI-Personal]. You just tried to call me?
Nurse: Um, I believe I did give me one second so I can pull up your chart. Ok. Sure. All right. And [PHI-Personal], you're a patient of doctor, correct? Yes. All right. So, yes, the reason why I was reaching out to you, um, and let me just tell you that this call is gonna be recorded for training purposes. The reason why I was reaching out to you is because doctor has a new service, um, that she's offering her patients that have Medicare insurance and that service is called Care Management. So with that you would get a phone call from a care management nurse and that phone call would be as frequently or as infrequently as you wish. And she basically just checks in on you, make sure that you're feeling well managing your BP or any anxiety or depression issues. You may have, uh, make sure that your medications are working. She could also help you with any acute issues or problems that may come up in between your office visits with your doctors. Ok. So those phone calls are a available service to your Medicare insurance. And doctor does get documentation um of those phone calls sent to her. So they are a part of your medical record.
Patient: Ok. Well, that is something else to say before I answer you.
Nurse: I don't, that's all I have to say.
Patient: Well, here, here's the thing. Um, now when you say nurse calling as, as, oh, you know what [PHI-Personal], I have a business call coming through. Can I call you back in a couple minutes?
Nurse: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Ok. Thank you. Uh huh, bye bye bye.
