Nurse: Hey, there. I is [PHI-Personal] there. Yes, ma'am. Let's see if she's on the phone. Hold on. Thank you. You're welcome.
Patient: Good morning. This is
Nurse: [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal]. It's [PHI-Personal] Fisher from Williams Sport P A. Yeah. How are you? Well, I'm not doing that bad but tomorrow's my endoscopy, but my husband is having some issues and since he's on your team, now, I wondered if I could please explain what's going on. Absolutely. Ok. He has severe carpal tunnel. I have a time line. And do you want me to go down that quickly
Patient: If you want to? Yeah, that's fine. Yeah,
Nurse: I don't know. That might give you another insight into this. It had started many years ago when he started tightening a shower head extension. But every now and then he'll get some pain in his left arm when he's sleeping and he overlooks it. Well, on [PHI-Personal]. Ok. Well, beginning of [PHI-Personal], he started what he thought was radial nerve pain in his left arm down to his fingers. Ok. He has a neurologist that he sees for Myasthenia Gravis in [PHI-Geographic]. A doctor [PHI-Personal]. So he went to see him on the [PHI-Personal]. Now several weeks had gone by and the pain had stopped. So he said, well, we'll watch it and he scheduled him for an EMG test way out in [PHI-Personal] because the pain had stopped, you know. So on the [PHI-Personal], just three days later, the medial nerve started up in about the same left wrist and hand. So he called doctor [PHI-Personal] and he said, see your family doctor. Ok. So on [PHI-Personal], the first, uh, Doctor [PHI-Personal] was busy. So he saw [PHI-Personal] who is the pa for Doctor [PHI-Personal]. Ok. Yeah, when she examined him, she thought it might be tendonitis and she said we'll wait until after the EMG to see what is going on. Ok. On [PHI-Personal], the second, Doctor [PHI-Personal] was able to reschedule that EMG. So he went to evangelical on the second and they did the nerve, the loss is it con test or either NVC or N one of those initials N CS. The nerve did, uh, the nurse did the first one and then the doctor did the EMG. And he said [PHI-Personal], you have severe carpal tunnel. But the thing is he thinks that the tendon is causing some problems either making the carpal tunnel worse or a problem all in its own because he has some swelling in the wrist there at the tendon area, which is what [PHI-Personal] had seen too. Ok. So he said you need to have immediate care. You should have an MRI or AC T scan to find out what is going on with the tendon. Ok. And then you need to see an orthopedic surgeon immediately. So he said I'm going to send all the notes to Doctor [PHI-Personal]. Now, this was Friday. Ok. And I figured I would wait today because I figured they would be calling and ate. Uh, when you try to get on the portal for evangelical, we can't pull down the doctor's notes that were sent. They're in the middle of changing it to my chart. So, so we can't get anything on the portal, which we would be reading those to see again, the severity which it is severe. And I thought, I said, [PHI-Personal], I'm gonna call [PHI-Personal] because she'll get a hold of Missy and Doctor [PHI-Personal] to see what they are going to do. And we don't know, I think Doctor [PHI-Personal] at evangelical is more or less letting it up to Doctor [PHI-Personal] now to schedule the MRI or CT Scan and to get to an orthopedic surgeon. Uh, I don't think we're supposed to do it. I think that was, the ball is in his court. Now, what does he want us to do? And who's supposed to schedule it? I think Doctor [PHI-Personal] has to schedule the, ah, further testing first, doesn't he?
Patient: Well, I'm trying to think here because if, if Doctor [PHI-Personal] wants, um, [PHI-Personal] to go see an orthopedic specialist, um, typically that information typically that he would have, I would have thought he would have been the one that would have referred him to an orthopedic surgeon. No,
Nurse: He's turning everything back to both times. He did. You know he did that. We were lucky to get in for that emg sooner. Right. Because it wasn't gonna be until [PHI-Personal]. But he's had, uh, now the pain is under, under control and everything, but there's still some swelling that we ice every day and he's sleeping well, he's not in extre not in extreme pain because we're doing the bio freeze, the bracing the ice, the heat, the excedrin, same thing that we did before all along and that's kept it in check. Ok.
Patient: Good, good.
Nurse: But he needs immediate help here and it's in [PHI-Personal] Blakeslee is out of it. He just did the testing.
Patient: Ok. Ok. So sle out of it, it does look like we have at least gotten the EMG information, um, as far as like results and all of that. Now, um, after, I don't know, I kind of looks like maybe we would have gotten those like later afternoon on Friday. Um, so I'm thinking that doctor probably has not addressed, been able to address anything just yet. But, um, [PHI-Personal], what I can do is I can send a message to Missy and to Doctor [PHI-Personal], um, to let them know that if doctor, you know, if we're gonna go ahead with this orthopedic, um, referral then we need to get that process of going there and see what it's gonna take to be able to do that. And I'll let them know too that Doctor [PHI-Personal] was, you know, saying that it needs to go through Doctor [PHI-Personal]. Now, um as far as to get that process going there and
Nurse: See Doctor [PHI-Personal] has to do all the referrals.
Patient: Ok. Ok. Which is, which is fine. Um I will let him know that you know that this is kind of where we're at with everything and give him an update so we can kind of get things, get the ball rolling here. Um, and I'll let him know that, you know, right now, the pain is, is controlled, but you were told that [PHI-Personal] was told that he needs to be, have some immediate, um, care here to get things, get things going for that severe carpal tunnel and that tendon that's, that's causing some
Nurse: Issues. Um, they said it could be, he said the tendon could be involved with the carpal tunnel or it could be if the tenon there's something all by itself there. Oh, goodness. But he said, I mean, he thinks it's a carpal tunnel definitely. But like he explained, there's mild, moderate and severe the levels and his is severe at this point. Ok. Yeah. Which, so everything happened within almost a month, you know, starting with the ninth on [PHI-Personal]. That's why I decided to do a timeline for you. Yeah. And, and where, where we are today and again, it, it would have to happen on a Friday [PHI-Personal] law. Right. Right. So, I won't panic. I'm not panicking. I just figured I know who to reach out to. And, uh, I will see then what you can do. And I said we actually, we don't need referrals to see a specialist, but since Doctor [PHI-Personal] sent all the information to [PHI-Personal], I think I feel better if he's the one that does the referring. Oh, ok. And did you say you think that first you see the orthopedist before you are scheduled and, uh, we'll say an MRI before you're scheduled, that
Patient: It depends on what doctor wants to do. So, um, you know, sometimes they will do the MRI, you know, before you see a specialist,
Nurse: He would make the most sense so that the, that they have the surgeon has the information then to take the next step, whether it's surgery, you know, carpal tunnel surgery or what. But again, that's not up to you or me. Is it, that's up to the right.
Patient: We gotta go, we gotta go their route and see which way, you know. But I totally, totally agree. That does make the most sense. Um, but I don't know, in this case or any other case, you know, it's kind of like a, you know, depends on, on how things are, are going and whatnot. So I will definitely let Doctor [PHI-Personal] know that we need
Nurse: To, the urgency then is, is to whomever we're going, he's going to see. Uh it's, you know, it's gotta be somebody hopefully we're not a couple of months out but I with, with immediate urgency that and I think they said Doctor [PHI-Personal] put that in his notes like a sp or, or I don't know what he worded but said it was urgent, you know they addressed it that
Patient: Way. Ok. Ok. Let me just, I'm gonna review this really quick just to see.
Nurse: Do you want, do you want me to listen to you to down it or do you, do you want me to go back over mine or?
Patient: Well, I'm just looking to see if there's any thing in
Nurse: Here. Oh, you're looking at the doctor's
Patient: Note. Yeah. Yeah, I was looking to see what Doctor Ke had sent over because like I said, I see that in here. Um, and the, the EMG report or the EM. Yeah. Yep. The testing that he had had, um, done. I'm just, no, no, you're fine. No, no, no, I, I can think and read at the same time. It's ok most of the time I can anyways. Um, it doesn't say it just talks about the swelling in the wrist. Um, but it does talk about the orthopedic evaluation. Um, let's see. And I don't know and that is all I can see. Oh,
Nurse: My gosh. You think he would write on there severe carpal tunnel. Well, that's not mentioned.
Patient: Let me pull this up, this report for some reason is only, I don't know, not pulling up this, I'm having issues today. So it's, it's one of those, you know, that's one of those Monday things
Nurse: I know. Why don't I let you go and let you go over your stuff and, you know, our urgency now and that the doctor did tell [PHI-Personal] that. Matter of fact, he told em that both times when he back in [PHI-Personal] the 30th, he said, go see Doctor [PHI-Personal] regarding this. It wasn't, ah, a neurological, you know, he's, he's a, he's a neuro neuro, I can't talk. Now. He's a neurologist, you know. So he said that definitely he's gonna turn it back to Doctor [PHI-Personal] and then [PHI-Personal], of course, is involved too be. And her record should be there from [PHI-Personal] the first. Yeah. When I saw her.
Patient: Yep, I do see
Nurse: Those. Yeah. And so she mentioned the tendonitis but, and like I said, then it was on the second when the testing was done at evangelical and he sent it all, turned it over to Doctor [PHI-Personal]. Ok.
Patient: Ok.
Nurse: But it should have been, well, he said he was going to put it but it's not in the report.
Patient: Well, not that I could see. And of course, you know, that's it. I, I think it's only, it, only half downloaded. So, um, you know we'll have to see, but I will let Doctor [PHI-Personal] know that, um, what Doctor [PHI-Personal] had told [PHI-Personal] and we can go, then we'll just kind of go from there as far as getting that process started for, for him and, and getting things moving. Ok.
Nurse: Yeah, I don't know what Doctor [PHI-Personal] calls him. [PHI-Personal] name is [PHI-Personal] and that's where we get the [PHI-Personal] from, from the Lan on Oran. So, I mean, doctor and I don't know, and doctor funk his other doctors, they didn't know what to call him because I, his friends and family say [PHI-Personal] and I think Missy calls him [PHI-Personal]. Uh, some people call him OJ for or, and J, and the doctor, I don't know what he calls him. So I hope when you say [PHI-Personal], uh, Missy will know that you should know and then you're calling him [PHI-Personal]. That's [PHI-Personal]. Yeah, a lot of people go, you know, they get it all mixed up. But, ok, so I thought I better make that, you know, I don't know. I don't know what Doctor [PHI-Personal] calls him and neither did [PHI-Personal]. He said I will miss, he calls me. Ok. I just wanted to get that point across.
Patient: Ok, sounds good. Well, [PHI-Personal], I'll, I will get that, uh, get that process started and if there's anything, any further updates or anything, I'll give you a call.
Nurse: Ok. Ok. And then we just wait tight until we hear from Doctor [PHI-Personal] office probably on this. Yeah.
Patient: Yeah. Depending on whether or not he sends it back over to me or if she, you know, she takes care of it, we'll see kind of how that process goes. But somebody will, should be in touch when we start getting things moving here. Ok.
Nurse: Thank you so much. I'm so darn glad that I got on with NY with you last week. I mean, that's a miracle that I just even thought to do that. So it was
Patient: Just good timing. Absolutely good timing for sure
Nurse: Because I trust in you and I put my faith in you and I said to [PHI-Personal], I know who I'm calling. So I thank you so much and uh I will wait and see what they tell us then.
Patient: Ok. Sounds good, [PHI-Personal]. You take care and we will um probably talk soon. I'm sure I'm sure we'll
Nurse: Get the endoscopy so we're gonna be gone all morning long, you know, and he drives with it, he keeps his brace on and is careful with it. But because I don't drive and he's my driver and I hope, I mean when he, once he has, if he has surgery, he probably won't be allowed to, but we'll take that when we come to it.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. One thing, one thing at a time, right?
Nurse: Ok, so
Patient: And no problem Carol, we'll talk later. Alrighty, bye bye bye bye.
