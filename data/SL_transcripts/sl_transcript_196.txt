Patient: Hi. Um, is [PHI-Personal] there.
Nurse: Um, I, that was me who just gave you a call back. Is this [PHI-Personal]?
Patient: Yes. Um, I, my, my cousin had, I was on the phone, I couldn't, couldn't pick up the call.
Nurse: That's ok. So I was, um, returning some of [PHI-Personal] calls. So the reason for the call is, it looks like you may be eligible for doctor is care management program. And so what that is, is a nurse that'll be able to give you a call around once a month to see how you're doing. She could help refill prescriptions, address any issues you're having. She could also help with appointments and lab work, things like that. Oh, you
Patient: Know, I don't really need that right now.
Nurse: Well, they're around a once a month call and I, I could always extend that if it's better for you, like every other month, every three months, something like that. That sounds better.
Patient: You know, I just don't think I'm at the point where I need that kind of follow up. Um, you know, I'm pretty independent. Um, you know, I, I, right now I, you know, I have you know, I have everything kind of organized and, um, know what's coming up. And so, yeah. Yeah, I just don't think I need that support right now, but at some point I may.
Nurse: Right. Well, do you mind if I send out some information that has a phone number in case you need anything? No,
Patient: I don't mind if you said something that's fine.
Nurse: Ok. And are you still at the 1 10 Beach View Avenue unit 2 16 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. All right, Judith. Well, thanks for giving me a call back. I'll send out some information. Ok, thank you. All right, you're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Alright, bye bye.
