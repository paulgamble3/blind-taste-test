Nurse: Good morning. This is [PHI-Personal]. How may I help you?
Patient: I don't know [PHI-Personal], this is [PHI-Personal]. I seen your number on my phone.
Nurse: Hi [PHI-Personal]. Yeah, I got a message from you yesterday stating that you didn't realize you had the appointment yesterday. Oh yeah, it happens, it happens but they they are charging you the $[PHI-Personal].
Patient: Well, um who usually pays for my visits there
Nurse: Who pays for your visits?
Patient: Yeah,
Nurse: I am not sure. Um usually it's it's you unless you have like um um oh my God, what are they called? They're like a case manager that you know, helps you with, manage your money. Do you have a person like that? No, no. Ok, so then yeah it would have to come uh um out of your your pocket.
Patient: Alright. What what appointment was this that I missed?
Nurse: Ok, let me pull up your
Patient: Chart. Sorry about that. And besides that they got my name wrong. It says [PHI-Personal]. It ain't [PHI-Personal], it's just [PHI-Personal]. Oh
Nurse: Yeah. Oh, how did they mess that
Patient: Up? Well, very easily [PHI-Personal] instead of Jenks. Yeah, I guess
Nurse: Let me see what kind of appointment it was
Patient: Ok. Oh, wait a minute. Um, how could I miss an appointment? Oh, right. Is this card says it's from Lakeland, Florida?
Nurse: I don't know what card that is.
Patient: I don't,
Nurse: Originally it was scheduled, um, they wanted to discuss, they, you had the appointment for your follow up from the hospital. Um, and there was some cognitive issues that they didn't address. So they made another appointment for you, um, originally on the second of [PHI-Personal]. But then because the [PHI-Geographic] was closed, they moved it to the fifth. I don't know when it was done. Oh, look at, uh, [PHI-Account] and they mailed the letter to you. And so I'm assuming you got it because it got rescheduled.
Patient: Right. Hopes I got papers in my lap and I don't even know what? Oh, all right. Who am I talking with right now, please? Sure. It's
Nurse: [PHI-Personal] with [PHI-Geographic], medical services. So, [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Geographic].
Patient: No, that's ok. Uh, uh, so I missed an appointment at, at the. Mhm. Right. Well, I have been kind of like under the weather and I haven't really done much of anything. Mhm.
Nurse: Do you feel like you're a little forgetful?
Patient: Well, yeah, a little, yeah.
Nurse: Yeah. So, I mean, usually what I, I tell patients, um, if they have like, a little bit of forgetfulness is, um,
Patient: Make a joke past side effect
Nurse: Of nausea from, sorry. Um, I would write this, the, um, appointment reminder down but then what I'd also do, is make sure that I have, um, somebody else who will remind me.
Patient: Yeah. Well, I, I usually have an aide but, um, I guess I didn't, I just, I, I guess I just forgot. II, I can't make excuse because I, I don't have any, I just, I don't, that said that I had an appointment anyhow. That's not, it, it,
Nurse: They do mail them to you, um, appointment reminders or appointment changes. Um, but they call as well and I think like a lot of times not, I'm not blaming you or anything. Um, a lot of times you do have some confusion so you forget.
Patient: Yeah, that seems to be happening a lot lately. Yeah.
Nurse: Sorry. Yeah. No. Hey, um that's why he wanted you to come into the [PHI-Geographic] to see if there was some kind of like test that they can do or to see what's going on like if it's um, a complication because of, you know, some changes in the brain or if it's a medication even though you don't take any, um, you know, I wanted to just review that with you. I think that's a, that would be a good appointment to reschedule.
Patient: Yeah, because I, I don't, I don't take anything. I um, I have more cars around here. I'm trying to figure out who it is. I'm talking with. Mm. Mhm. Ok. Oh, crying out loud. Bye. That's about it. Let's see. Being [PHI-Personal]. Um, who am I talking with again. I'm sorry,

Patient: There. I'm sorry about that. But
Nurse: No, no, I mean, it's, it's age related change but it's also, there's definitely something else that's going on in your, in your head. I don't know, like, if, you know, sometimes people have like mini strokes and they don't know that because they're still, like, able to do things and say things like, without any slurred speech or, or, you know any like anything like that but they might have like a lot of forgetfulness so you know hopefully they they you know chad can do uh an assessment and get you some tests and we could see what's going on.
