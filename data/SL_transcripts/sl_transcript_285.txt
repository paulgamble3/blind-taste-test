Nurse: Hello, this is Missy. Hello. Hi. Is this Brenda? This is B mcdonald. Hello, this is Missy and I gave you a call the other day. It looks like, yes, one second here pulling you out. Ok. So it looks like you're eligible for Doctor Ocampo's Care management program. And so what that is, is the nurse nurse that will be able to give you a call to see how you're doing. She answers any questions, refills prescriptions, she'll address any issues that you're having and she could have help with appointments and lab work. Things like that. The program helps keep the doctors updated and it avoids emergency room visits and all the calls the nurse makes are documented and sent to the doctor for review. They are treated as a available service to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans and secondary insurance carriers and they're also subject to deductibles, coinsurance and copays. So I have here, United United Healthcare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Is that still correct? Yes. Ok. And do you prefer morning or afternoon phone calls from the nurse? Um, I guess afternoon. Ok. Are you still at 6005, North Highland Avenue, Tampa, Florida. 33604. Yes. Ok. I'll also send out a letter. It has all the information on it, plus the phone number to call in to the nurse if you need to. And then your first phone call from the nurse should be within a week or two. Ok. Ok. All right. Well, that's all I need for today. Thanks for giving me a call back. Well, ok. Alrighty, have a good day. Alright. thank you. Bye. Alright, bye bye.
