Nurse: Hello, this is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hi. Yes, I'm, um, this is [PHI-Personal] calling. I spoke to you before. Yeah. So, um, I just got off the phone with [PHI-Personal] and they said they didn't understand why, when I called, um, the prescription drug plan, why they couldn't do their job and bring it up on the computer and know exactly what I was dealing with. They said what happens is Prolia falls into the senior donut hole. So she said the init, she said he does have coverage for the, for the Prolia shot that the first shot would be, you know, $[PHI-Account]. Then the next time he gets it would be $[PHI-Personal]. So, um, I don't know if there's another drug that would work just as well as this or we should go ahead and have them order this drug.
Nurse: Well, I would hate for you guys to have to pay that kind of money.
Patient: I know if there's something else on the market that would be equally as, as good for him, you know, at this, at this point, you know. Um, I don't know, like if the doctor wanted the shot because it works faster. I, you know, I don't really know that much about bone density.
Nurse: Right. Um, typically it's because patients are more compliant with taking a shot twice a year than taking a pill once a week.
Patient: Well, it doesn't matter to us. He already takes, I, I do all his pills every week, so it's just a matter of putting it in the right day.
Nurse: Ok. So let me send a message over to doctor and let her know what the cost is gonna be um and then I can let you know something. All
Patient: Right that will work that'd be good. Alright so give me a great so we'll wait to hear from you before we do anything and and then um find out what what he's gonna take. Alright. Ok thank you so much. Uh huh bye bye. Ok bye bye.
