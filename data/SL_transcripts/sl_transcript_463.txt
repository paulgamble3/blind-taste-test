Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hi, [PHI-Personal]. [PHI-Personal]. This is [PHI-Personal] job returning your call from yesterday. Hi,
Nurse: [PHI-Personal], how are you? I'm
Patient: Fine. I'm fine. I'm a patient of doctor. You wanted to talk about the care management
Nurse: Program? I did. Can I just have one second to pull up your information real quick? Sure. Mhm. All right. All right. So, [PHI-Personal], yes. Um, let me just let you know that this call is gonna be recorded for quality and training purposes and, and I did reach out, um, because doctor [PHI-Personal] has a new, um, care management program out of the office. And are you familiar with what care management is? No? Ok. Ok. So you qualify for this program with your Medicare health insurance. And basically you would get a phone call from a care management nurse. Your first phone call, your n you and your nurse would, um, make a care plan and she would, you and her would decide how frequently you would like to get a phone call from her. Those phone calls can be as frequently or as infrequently as you wish. Um, basically she could call you just to check in on you make sure you're tolerating your medications. Ok. Um, make sure that you're feeling ok and basically just to make sure that, um, you're staying nice and healthy in between office visits with Doctor [PHI-Personal]. Oh, ok. Ok. Yeah, it's, um, it's, it's definitely a great service, you know, just, um, just here to make sure that you're staying on track with all your, you know, your medications and your health and all, and all things like that.
Patient: Oh, great, great idea.
Nurse: Yeah. So all the, um, so you know that all of the phone calls are documented, um, and sent to Doctor [PHI-Personal] and they are bill to your Medicare health insurance. Um, so do you think that I can go ahead and get you set up for a phone, a first phone call with a nurse? Sure. Awesome. So it looks like your nurse would be Z and typically [PHI-Personal] contacts patients within a week from this initial phone call that you're having with me. And in the meantime, I'm gonna mail you out some information. Ok. I have that you live at [PHI-Geographic]? Mhm. Ok. And, uh, [PHI-Personal], do you have a phone number that you wish your nurse would call you on or does it not matter?
Patient: Uh, I think you're calling me from the cell phone. I'm not sure. Uh, [PHI-Account].
Nurse: Ok. You would like the, the cell phone number. Yes. All right. All right. So, [PHI-Personal], um, like I said, I'm gonna mail you out some information and then your nurse should be getting, um, giving you your first phone call within a week or so. Uh, if you, if you feel that you need to speak with someone sooner, whenever you get that letter, there will be a phone number on there and you can reach out, um, reach out to that phone number if you need it before she calls you.
Patient: Oh, wonderful, wonderful. I have do you have
Nurse: Phone number? I do not have a direct number for [PHI-Personal]. The only thing I have
Patient: I just wanna answer it when it when they call because some I don't answer the phone. I don't know
Nurse: So I know that they're all like in a I don't know how to explain it like all the phone numbers are in a pool and I can give you what I believe the number could be or what it'll kind of look like. So looks like that number could potentially be [PHI-Account]. Uh huh [PHI-Account]. Uh huh. [PHI-Account]. Ok. Ok.
Patient: Alright.
Nurse: Alright. Well [PHI-Personal] I appreciate you calling me back. I appreciate your time and I hope that you have a great day. Thanks [PHI-Personal]. You too. Alright. Thank you so much. Bye
