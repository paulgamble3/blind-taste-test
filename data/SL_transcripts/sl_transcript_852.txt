So you're a patient of doctor [PHI-Personal] at pediatric [PHI-Geographic] family health care, correct? I am. All right. So let me just tell you real quick that this call is gonna be recorded for training purposes. Ok, that's fine. All right.

Um, did you get anything in the mail in regards to that new program?
Patient: Well, no, I don't do mail.
Nurse: Ok. Cool. No problem. My
Patient: Wife does
Nurse: All that. Ok. Ok. Um, so yeah, I'm just following up with a phone call to let patients know that the physicians within op started offering their [PHI-Personal] patients a new program called Care Management. So with that, you would receive a phone call from doctor [PHI-Personal] Care Management nurse [PHI-Geographic] she would call you in between appointments, she would check in to make sure that you're feeling well, your medications are working [PHI-Geographic] you're not having any new issues or problems in between those visits. You would also be able to contact your nurse directly if you had any medical questions or concerns or if you needed assistance with things like medication refills, test results or scheduling appointments. Excuse me. So it is a billable service to [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] Advantage [PHI-Geographic] secondary insurance plans [PHI-Geographic] the calls are subject to deductibles, copays [PHI-Geographic] co insurance. Now, you have [PHI-Personal] Primary with State Farm Secondary. Is that correct? Correct? Ok. And you don't pay any copays when you go to the office. Is that also correct?
Patient: I don't think we do. All
Nurse: Right, then you should not be responsible for any out of pocket cost for a call from your nurse. And you would be able to choose how frequently she calls you. You could choose to get a call once a month, once every three months or just every six months. And doctor [PHI-Personal] would get documentation of those calls sent to him as part of your medical record. Ok. Do you think I can? Yeah. Do you think I can go ahead [PHI-Geographic] get that set up for you? You probably could. All right, perfect.
