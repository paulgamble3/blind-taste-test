Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. You've been calling me? Um, yeah, give me one second to pull up your medical record. All right. And can you spell your last name for me, please? Ro Un [PHI-Personal]? All right, and just confirm your birthday. [PHI-Account]. Perfect. So [PHI-Personal], let me just tell you that this call is gonna be recorded for training purposes. And the reason why I have been calling you is because Doctor [PHI-Personal] has a new service that she's offering her patients that have Medicare insurance and, and that service is called care management. So with that you would get a phone call from a care management nurse and that phone call would be at your convenience as frequently or as infrequently as you wish. And she basically just calls you to check in on you. Make sure you're managing your medications. Ok. Make sure sure you're feeling well with any anxiety or depression issues you may have, but she could also help you with any acute issues or problems that may come up in between office visits with your doctors. Ok. Ok. Um, so it is a billable service to your uh, um, your Medicare insurance and Doctor [PHI-Personal] does get documentation of the phone calls sent to her as a part of your medical record. Ok. Ok. Does it sound like something I can get you set up for sure. All right. So, um your nurse, it looks like her name is going to be [PHI-Personal] and she should reach out to you within the next week or so. But in the, in the meantime, I'm gonna mail you some information. Um I have that you live at [PHI-Geographic], right? All right, perfect. And is this actually your apartment, is it [PHI-Geographic]. Ok. Let me just specify that. Ok. And then um the phone number that you're calling me on now, is this the best number to be reached at or is there another phone number that you would like for her to call? No, this is this is my cell phone. You've been calling my landline phone? Oh, ok. Do you want me to take that one out of there? Yeah, because I I've never really answered that phone. Ok. All right. So I'll take that one out of there and I'm gonna put in the [PHI-Account] [PHI-Account]. All right, perfect. So I'm gonna mail you out some information and then your nurse [PHI-Personal] should reach out to you within the next week or so? Ok. Ok. Alright [PHI-Personal] thank you for calling me back.
