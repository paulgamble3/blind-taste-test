Nurse: Speaking, how can I help you? Hi is [PHI-Personal] there, please. Uh Who's calling? This is [PHI-Personal] calling for [PHI-Personal]. Ok, hold one second. Thank you. You're welcome.
Patient: Check to healthcare. This is [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: Hi [PHI-Personal]. My name is I've spoken to you a couple. I I wanna say about a week ago, [PHI-Personal], it was [PHI-Personal] last day. I was wondering if we ever got to put to invoke the healthcare proxy. We needed a letter.
Patient: Oh, ok. Can you verify [PHI-Personal] date of birth
Nurse: For me? 0303, 1937
Patient: [PHI-Account]. There she is. Ok. Let's see where we are on that. Let me get up to speed here.
Nurse: Nope, not a problem.
Patient: Ok. Letter stating that healthcare proxy should be invoked. Written please fax this to the medical records department that was on uh [PHI-Personal]. Let me see if that's been scanned. Yeah, I see some orders. Oh, there it is. Yes, it was faxed on [PHI-Account]
Nurse: Uh [PHI-Account]. Awesome. Thank you so much and just I have another question back. Um I wanna say it was probably [PHI-Personal] 26th a letter from um her heritage and sandwich sent a letter into the file. I know [PHI-Personal] had seen it uh stating that mom did not have bipolar. Do you happen to have that in her file? I did not see it in her records and says that they never received it. I know [PHI-Personal], the social worker did send it over to them.
Patient: Hey, let me look.
Nurse: Yeah, it was, it wa I wanna say roughly about the 26th. It was a Tuesday. I probably could find it better for you because I know it was I can get the date better for you. Yeah, that was kind of crazy. Um It was actually the [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Ok. They did not I see I see a a list of diagnoses from the [PHI-Personal] but it does show that the the bipolar on there. So um they were supposed to fax a letter, right?
Nurse: Yeah. Yeah it was doctor um was going to send a letter over because the problem is is we all of a sudden it came up for just in mom's file. We we don't even know um where it came from. Even doctor said that he he didn't diagnose mom with bipolar. He because by the time he um she you know the dementia was too far gone to even doing it and we don't know how it got in her record and plus her record when I'm coming up on the 20th which is fine. I mean on the 30th for her doctor's appointment. But there's so many errors in her medical history that we don't know if other diagnosis or other things got into her file that don't belong to her because it says her mother died at [PHI-Personal] of breast cancer. Her mother did not die at [PHI-Personal]. She died at like 8, 79 80 of bone marrow cancer. My mother has never had a broken foot. Like there's so many in discrepancies in her file that um all of a sudden out of nowhere, this bipolar came and [PHI-Personal] was not going to accept her. And um [PHI-Personal] from the social workers over at [PHI-Geographic] [PHI-Personal] had doctor [PHI-Personal] send a letter stating that she did not have it. And when I had spoken to [PHI-Personal], she said she saw that letter OK, in her file.
Patient: Let me look and see. I apologize about that. That was a alarm on a different patient. Uh Give me just a moment. I do see something here from the [PHI-Personal]. It was, was it like a neuro testing neurological evaluation? OK. So that is in the chart. I do see that on the [PHI-Personal] and that's about five pages long
Nurse: And it does say no bipolar.
Patient: Let me give me just a moment to scan. No, no, no, you're fine.
Nurse: Is there any way you can email that to me? Just due to the fact that I'd like because it states it in her file and we're trying to get it removed that I could actually have the tangible copy so that I can address that with people because the problem is still hasn't received it and it's just causing a lot of headaches. I hate to say that but it is saying that she has bipolar when she doesn't. Bye because unfortunately it, it somehow got in her medical records.
Patient: Bye. I'm on, I'm still on page one. I'm sorry. There's a lot to it. I don't see anything about it on page one. So let's go to the next one. Ok. Ok. There's some memory testing. It was a very in depth that. Yeah.
Nurse: Yeah, because they weren't gonna let her in because it said that she had bipolar with behavioral issues and it was like, whoa, where did that come from?
Patient: Mhm. Ok. It does say on the very last page there was no evidence of bipolar disorder at this testing. Ok. Um, so I don't know that I can email this to you and you're in [PHI-Geographic], am I right? Correct. Yeah. Ok. I do remember some things I thought, I thought you were in [PHI-Geographic]. Ok. So I
Nurse: Don't think that ok, if I get the email for [PHI-Personal] who is at [PHI-Personal], her email, can you send that to her?
Patient: I don't think that I can let me, uh let me give you this number from the memory and attention center. Ok. And give them a call. To see if they can fax it to. Ok. Ok. That would probably be the best way. Ok, and their number on this page is [PHI-Account]. Yep [PHI-Account]. Yep, [PHI-Account].
Nurse: Thank you so much. Ok,
Patient: You're welcome. Thank you very much. Not a problem. Mhm. Bye bye.
