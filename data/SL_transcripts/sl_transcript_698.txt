Nurse: Got a little concerned because they said you missed a couple appointments in the office. Were you aware of that?
Patient: No, I have, you know, no clue, you know, when I supposed to go or anything, you know? Ok.
Nurse: Ok. So they, they said you had like three missed appointments since [PHI-Personal]. So I want to make sure we're on because, you know, like I, I get nervous because, oh, yeah. Yeah. If you, if you miss too many then they won't see you anymore and then you won't have anybody to order your medicine. Right. Right. I want to make sure, do you have a next appointment written down anywhere for doctor? [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Oh, I don't believe I do, honey. I don't believe I do. No, let me, I'm looking at my calendar. Let me look for next month. No, nothing on [PHI-Personal]. I have no, no, I don't anything

Patient: Phone? I got, I, I, no, no, I got, uh, uh right on my calendar and I look at it every morning so I just write this right on my calendar here. I'm writing it right down right now. Ok. Yeah, I, because I,
Nurse: I got a little worried because Doctor [PHI-Personal], you know, if you miss one with him it's like pulling teeth to get another one. So I,
Patient: I, oh, I know because last time I got his, his son, I thought he would change, change a new to the boy, you know. So. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, ok. And my medicine. Ok. Now I have it through the mail, right. You know, it comes on, you know, uh, do I have to do anything on that or would they just renew it automatically or? Well, when it's due, let's see. Let me take a peek here. I'm just checking to see, you know, they sent me my insulin the other day, but I'm talking about my pills.
Nurse: Did, have you been getting the pills from them?
Patient: I, that's what I'm, I think that the first ones I got from them. Yeah. You know, I'm pretty sure I did but I'm not sure because I, you know, I went from, to them so I don't know if these are, if these were from or, you know, because I don't have to have them because they give me those, you know, 30 days supply. So, and I'm not out, but I just was thinking, you know, will I get them automatically or? No? Well,
Nurse: It doesn't look like we've sent any to, um, any prescriptions to, to express scripts. The [PHI-Personal] wasn't sent there. Um, do you need all your prescriptions then sent to express scripts?
Patient: Yes. If you would do that, that would be perfect for me. You know, I, I would appreciate it. You know, it'd be so much easier for me because I can't get the, you know, it's too hard for me to get out there. I have to get somebody to take me and you can't always do that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.
Nurse: Yeah. Let me, um, I'll have them. So, do you have enough medicines for, like, a week or two?
Patient: Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I just didn't want to run out. So I, that's why. Yeah.
