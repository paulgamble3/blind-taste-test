Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal] for I was returning your call.
Nurse: Hi, [PHI-Personal], how are you? Good. Give me one second just to pull up your chart. Ok. Ok. All right. And [PHI-Personal], you're a patient of [PHI-Personal] Manger at [PHI-Geographic]. Is that correct? Yep. All right, perfect. Um, so let me just tell you real quick that this call is gonna be recorded for training purposes. Ok. All right. So the reason I was calling is because I received a referral from [PHI-Personal] requesting your enrollment to his new care management program. Now, did you receive anything in the mail in regards to that new program? No. Ok. So some patients got a letter in the mail and some did not. So I'm just following up with a phone call. Um, basically the physicians within broad [PHI-Geographic] started offering their [PHI-Personal] patients a new program called Care Management. So with that you would receive a phone call from [PHI-Personal] Care Management Nurse and your nurse would basically just call you in between appointments. She would check in to make sure you're feeling good. Your medications are working and no new issues or problems have come up in between visits, but you would also be able to reach out to your nurse directly if you had any medical questions or concerns or if you needed assistance with things like refills, test results, appointments, things like that. Um So it is a billable service to [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] Advantage and secondary insurance plans and the calls are subject to deductibles, copays and coinsurance. Now, you have [PHI-Personal] Primary with [PHI-Personal] as your secondary. Is that correct? Yes. Ok. And you don't pay any copays when you go to the office. Is that also correct? That's correct. Yes. Ok, perfect. Then you should not be responsible for any out of pocket cost for a call from your nurse. And you would get to choose how frequently she calls. You, you could choose to get a call from her once a month, once every three months or every six months. And [PHI-Personal] would get documentation of those calls sent to him as part of your medical record. Ok. Ok. Do you think I can go ahead and get you set up for a call from your care management nurse?
Patient: Uh I, as long as there's no copays, I, I wouldn't want to do that as long as it's covered. I, I would do that. Yes. Ok,
Nurse: Perfect. Um, now the phone number I'm speaking with you on now, the 8145991312. Is that the best number for your nurse to reach you at. All right. And then I do need to mail you out some welcome information. I have that. Your address is 20086 mckendry Church Road and that's Three Springs 17264. Yep. All right, perfect. So I will go ahead and get this set up for you and your nurse should call you for your first call within the next 2 to 3 weeks. Ok. All right, Linda. Well, thanks for calling me back. I really do appreciate it and I hope you have a great rest of your day. You too. Thanks so much. Bye bye.
