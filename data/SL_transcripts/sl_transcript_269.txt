Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. Oh,
Patient: Hi, [PHI-Personal]. Uh, my name is [PHI-Personal]. You called and left a message for my husband to talk about some, a new policy or something with doctor. My husband is [PHI-Personal] Ru. I, hi, how are, how are you doing? Great. Thank you. Good.
Nurse: So, um, let me just tell you that this call is gonna be recorded for training purposes first and foremost, that's fine. And, um, the reason why I reached out is because your husband has, um, does he have [PHI-Personal] in or I'm sorry, [PHI-Personal] insurance.
Patient: He has [PHI-Personal], um, part a only. But other than that, we have [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: Ok. So with his [PHI-Personal] insurance, he qualifies for a new service that doctor is offering his patients and with that service and that service is called Care management. So, so with that he would get a phone call from a care management nurse and that phone call would be at his convenience as frequently or as infrequently as he wishes. Mhm. And the nurse just calls to check in on him, make sure that he's feeling well and managing his medications. Ok. Um, could help with medication refills or any acute issues or concerns that may come up in between office visits with doctor.
Patient: Well, you know what? I, I don't know if the [PHI-Personal] would actually cover that because he only for now has part a which is only hospitalization. Um, anything else. So, um my feeling is that [PHI-Personal] would not cover that. Ok.
Nurse: Yeah, it's just showing me that he has like plain [PHI-Personal]. It doesn't specify what kind. So, yeah, he
Patient: Know because he's still working. So he never went on the uh, the, the full [PHI-Personal]. He just, you know, when you get [PHI-Personal] I think they pretty much sign everybody up for part A but again, that's only for hospitalization and to tell you the truth. I mean, it, it's a good program but he seems to be doing well and I used to be a nurse myself, so I'm pretty much on top of things with. All right. So I don't, you know, I, you know, I, I think we're good of us anyway. That was wonderful. Oh,
Nurse: Yeah, no problem. Um, do, can I have your permission to mail you some information in case you were to change your mind once he does get full [PHI-Personal] insurance?
Patient: Yeah. Yeah, that would be. And you know what, just to tell you the truth, he's probably going to, I'm retiring. So, um, he'll be on [PHI-Personal] in a few months, uh, because he'll no longer have coverage through my employer. So please do that. Yes.
Nurse: All right. So I have that you guys live at [PHI-Geographic] in Pa. Yes, perfect. I'll mail out some information and just call that phone number on that letter whenever you um you know whenever you get the insurance stuff figured out.
Patient: Ok. That should be in July, but we will do that. Thank you, [PHI-Personal]. You're welcome. Have a good day. Thanks for,
Nurse: Thanks for calling me back. Alright, bye now.
