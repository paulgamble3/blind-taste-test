Nurse: Good morning. Thank you for calling Care Management. My name is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you today? Yeah. Uh you
Patient: People tried calling me. This is [PHI-Personal] calling.
Nurse: Oh, yes, [PHI-Personal], that would be me. Thank you for giving us a call back. I do wanna inform your calls are recorded for quality purposes. I'm with [PHI-Geographic] on behalf of [PHI-Personal] Care management team. Uh She's providing a new program where the nurse would be giving you a call. She'll check in, in between office visits. She'll answer questions or concerns. Help manage current health conditions can assist with medications, lab results, even community resources if needed and anything that pertains to your health, the nurse would be an added resource. Now, for our care management and behavioral health program, it is a billable service to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans and secondary insurance carriers would be considered an office visit. So it's subject to deductible, uh $5 copay that you have and co insurance. So you may receive a statement from the practice for those services. Now, um the nurse can reach out to you on a monthly basis, [PHI-Personal] or every couple of months that's completely up to you. Would you prefer if she reached out in the morning or afternoon?
Patient: Oh, it's not necessary. I, uh, I'm pretty good right now. I just got, uh, knee surgery done and I just had a six month check up. Uh, I, I'm pretty good, you know. So I, I'll just wait for my six month check up. No, no, uh, biggie.
Nurse: Ok. Not a problem, [PHI-Personal], if, uh, I'll mail out some information and if you do need us down the line ever have any questions the nurse can assist with prescription cost reductions. Anything that pertains to your health, any resources you may need, feel free to reach out to us then. Ok. Ok. Thank you for your time. [PHI-Personal]. Have a great day.
Patient: Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye.
