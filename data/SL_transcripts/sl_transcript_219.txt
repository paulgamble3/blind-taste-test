Nurse: This is speaking. May I help you?
Patient: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm ok. The reason I'm calling is I got a letter back today from dot That form I sent in for the, um for the handicap form. They told me it didn't need notarized. They sent it back to me along with the letter, say notarization is missing, applicant signature must be notarized. Can I just, can I just bring this in and have somebody notarize it?
Nurse: Um Let me confirm and find out, make sure we have a notary
Patient: In. I mean, that, I mean, my thing is, I guess it means I'm gonna have to go out and bring it in even though it's already signed, it's already signed. It just has to have a notary seal on it unless
Nurse: It's in most notaries, unless it's one that we have to have in our office won't notarize it unless they witness your signature.
Patient: Well, then we're gonna have to fill out a whole another form and they're gonna have to print it off. I'm just telling you what, what?
Nurse: No, no, you're fine. That's the handicap form. Right. Right.
Patient: And they said, they just said here,
Nurse: What was the company that sent it back? It was,
Patient: You gave it to, they gave it to me and said, well, this has to be notarized. No, they don't make them be notarized anymore. They said, every time I question them, I'm always right and they're always wrong. And I have to wait. This is like the teen time, you know, something they, they tell me. Nope, you don't need it and yet I do. My question is do I gotta run out there? Will they notarize or do I gotta go pay somebody to notarize
Nurse: It? Let me find out and call you
Patient: Right back. Alright? Thank you. Ok. You're welcome bye.
