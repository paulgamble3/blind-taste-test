And so we brought her in for that and they, they basically, they checked her out, they did blood work and then they gave us some Zofran and sent her home. Well, unfortunately, and they did, they, when they did the blood work, her sodium was 1 29 and, and the paperwork they gave us, it mentions hyponatremia, but we got home about 2 30 in the morning. And unfortunately I didn't really look at the paperwork and I don't remember them talking about. Uh, can you hold on a sec? Sure. No, no, no, please stay. I'll call you back, [PHI-Personal].
