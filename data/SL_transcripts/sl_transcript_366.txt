Patient: Cape Cod Healthcare. This is Brittany. Hi. Hi Teresa. Yeah. Mhm. I was calling to, let's see. Oh, ok. I was calling, I had got a refill request on your Valsartan. Oh, ok. Yeah. You know what? I was forgetting that the pharmacy wouldn't know my change of um of uh PC P. Well, I saw that in the computer and I, I that's why I was calling to make sure that you had established a new one. Are you seeing uh let's see someone at Family Medicine uh over at Community Health Center. I guess I actually thought they were gonna get in touch with doctor because he is actually the one I thought that um that have written that prescription for me. So maybe I'll just get in touch with this office. Ok. So what I'll do on my end is I'll just refuse it and put on there that you're no longer under uh prescriber care that way the pharmacy knows, but you'll get a Mychart message saying that it was declined. But that's, that's why because you're seeing uh someone else. So, yeah, give them a call and make sure you don't go without it. Ok. Ok. You're welcome. Bye bye Friday.
