Patient: Yeah, I'm telling you. This is ridiculous.
Nurse: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably good that you go in because she can do like a, you know, swab to see if it's like, you know, a strep throat situation and just kind of see what's going on.
Patient: Right. That's what I'm afraid of. I had had that years ago, years ago. Really? Yeah. And you know, but, and I've been fine ever since but yeah.
