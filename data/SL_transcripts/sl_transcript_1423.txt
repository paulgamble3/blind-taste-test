Yeah, I take it, yeah, I'm taking a tablet of that too. Or not a tablet but a soft gel. Uh-huh. So, everything now is, uh, centered on my knee. Uh, uh, I, I lost, uh, six lbs since I've been to the doctor. I'm trying to lose weight. I try to lose weight to see if it, it'll help my knee before I, he said, you know, try to lose weight before you do anything radical, like, you know, knee surgery or anything like that, you know, right replacement. So, I'm trying that [PHI-Personal], uh, everything center around my knee right now. My blood, my blood sugar is ok. You know, uh, II, I watch what I'm eating now, so I don't eat as much. I try to try to just right fast for about, like, six hours a day [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal]. Do you? Yeah.
Nurse: Yeah. What kind of stuff do you eat otherwise? Like, are you trying to cut out certain things? I
Patient: Mean, uh, I was eating salads, uh, uh, making, uh, sweet potatoes, uh, broccoli [PHI-Personal] cauliflower, not cauliflower but, uh, Brussels sprouts. Oh, that, [PHI-Personal], uh, I bought this stuff, all of my steaks. I, I was thinking, have like, uh, for supper. I'm having like a little piece of like a red, red meat [PHI-Personal] a hamburger. Uh, uh-huh, baked chicken. Yeah. Uh, oatmeal, uh, eggs. Uh, uh, I have my bread, you know, I still eat bread stuff but, uh, I try to cut out sweets. I think if I, I had like a sweet attack. So, if I, I cut out sweets, I think that to you.
Nurse: Yeah, definitely. And some, sometimes if you just cutting out, you know, the sweets, cutting out the soft drinks if you drink a lot of soft drinks.
Patient: No, the only thing I drink is like a B 12, uh, drink it. Uh, it's like a, it's like a B 12 shot. There's no, no sugar in it or anything.
Nurse: Ok. Well, that's good. It's
Patient: Called, I get it at Sam's [PHI-Personal]. Uh huh. You come in tubes, you put it in water [PHI-Personal] shake it up. Oh, ok.
Nurse: Yeah. I've heard that before.
Patient: Like two, like two of those right now I'm drinking, I may drink water [PHI-Personal] coffee. Yeah, the coffee is a diuretic. I go pee a lot but uh, trying to, I drink so much coffee but it's just my main drink right now. So a
Nurse: Couple of coffees a day is not too bad for you. Yeah. Black
Patient: Coffee. I drink [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: You don't put nothing in it. Oh, ok.
Patient: My air force days when I was working every night shift, drink a lot of [PHI-Personal] coffee. So. Oh,
Nurse: Ok. And once you get used to that, you know, that's, that's it. You don't have anything else in
Patient: It kind of addicting because if I don't drink at least a cup a day I get like one of those, uh, gaine headaches. Oh, do you? Yeah, I'm like, sort of like addicted to it, you know, a cup a day.
Nurse: Well, one cup a day keeps you moving. I'd say keep going for it. Especially since you don't put anything in it, you know, not, not a lot of sweeteners or sugar or creamers, all that stuff. That's not, not the greatest for you. Yeah.
Patient: Right. I don't drink those Dunkin Donut coffee. Oh, yeah. Lot of tea. Uh, no, they're more with cream [PHI-Personal] coffee in it. That's true. And then they say I got to have my cup of coffee [PHI-Personal] you go, [PHI-Personal] you get, like, go home with the,
Nurse: With a cup full of sugar [PHI-Personal] not much coffee actually. Yeah.
Patient: Right. I know. But anyway, that, that's what's going on with me. Yeah.
Nurse: Well, how much better do you think your knee is after the injection if you had
Patient: To percentage? Uh, it's, uh, I don't feel pain [PHI-Personal] it feels like it's, uh, I know it's only a temporary thing [PHI-Personal] because I used to get cortisone shots [PHI-Personal] I was, like, 30 years ago all the time because I used to get my, that's when I started getting my knee drained [PHI-Personal] everything. Uh-huh, for a while there, when I was to play a lot of tennis [PHI-Personal] stuff. That's, I got water on the knee. I used to get my knee drained. I get it once a month. Oh, ok. And I got, I got a few Cortisone shots then so I know it's not, uh, permanent. But yeah, it, uh, it helps a lot.
Nurse: Yeah. So what you think about 80% better or more or less?
Patient: Uh, I say it's like a, 100% better. Oh, ok. Well, that's awesome because now I, I can walk without feeling though, like it's going to give out on me, you know, uh-huh, before it was like tender [PHI-Personal] I was, I was walking [PHI-Personal] you feel the pain [PHI-Personal] they put one of these, these patches, the, uh, yeah, uh, pain relief help but not as much as the Cortisone shot.
Nurse: Yeah. What's those patches called? That's something you found over the also.
Patient: Yeah, I got these on the internet. They're called W Will Will Knee Pain Relief patch? Ok. Wellnee pain relief patch. I just ordered some again last night.
Nurse: Ok. Well, did you order it like off of Amazon or something or? So, or? You have to? Uh, no, I, I
Patient: Heard a commercial that I investigated on the internet. It's a specialty design for a knee area for increased flexibility. OK. So it's like, it's like uh the only way I got it was because I didn't want to pound down the ibuprofen [PHI-Personal], you know, I didn't want to take a bottle of, you know, yeah, I pound down a bottle a month of ibuprofen. So I don't take that. I just put these on [PHI-Personal] it's like it absorbs through the skin, you know, uh for uh so it's like pain relief that's absorbed directly to the skin instead of taking, taking the ibuprofen or, you know, regular because that's what I'm mainly concerned about because I need, I need a pain killer, but I didn't want to take Ibuprofen. I know what that does to your stomach.
Nurse: I know [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] sometimes can affect your kidney function [PHI-Personal] all that too.
Patient: So, uh so I take this, I take it right through the, right through the skin, right to the bone. Uh what it's called, it's the, well, the pain relief patch. Weolnee. Yeah. And long lasting natural warm wood formula, uh, remove.
Nurse: It sounds kind of like the sort of thing that those, the, uh, the release pills that you're taking too. Yeah.
Patient: It, uh, other ingredients are cinnamon menthol. [PHI-Personal]. Born, born, born [PHI-Personal] cancer.
Nurse: Ok. So, like cooling action in there. Yeah.
Patient: So, uh, yeah, ingredients are weird but [PHI-Geographic]. So I'm taking them. Yeah,
Nurse: I don't blame you. I think they sound good better than, you know, a lot of other products that are out there for sure.
Patient: I put them on my plate, my knife [PHI-Personal] fork [PHI-Personal] that's my supper.
Nurse: That's your
Patient: Supper. The four pills [PHI-Personal] other medicine I'm taking, I take about, like, without one a day [PHI-Personal], uh, fish oil [PHI-Personal] everything [PHI-Personal], uh, huh, like 10, 10 different pills.

Nurse: Yeah, I mean, your blood work looks, looks pretty good. And he checked your inflammatory markers in your blood too [PHI-Personal] those were normal. So, that's a good thing.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where I stand.
Nurse: Well, I'm glad you're doing well [PHI-Personal] you at least got some relief, you know, with the, with the knee injection.
Patient: Yeah. I didn't want, I didn't call you back the first time because, like, I had a doctor appointment, like, two days after you called. So,
