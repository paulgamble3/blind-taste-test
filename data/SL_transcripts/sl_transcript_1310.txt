Nurse: Much, ma'am. You're welcome. Do you need any refills on anything?
Patient: Yeah. Uh, well, the pain doctor. Uh well, I have to go see him for that. Uh, the, the Express meds. I, I, I've taken care of that. Um, oh, there was a, a med I was getting prescribed for my eyes. I, I have a permanent, uh uh, what they call that stuff when, when they put permanent uh covers on your eyes. Uh Oh, [PHI-Personal],
Nurse: What do you have? Cataracts?
Patient: Cataracts? I have permanent uh things in my eyes. Uh not cover the lenses. Ok. And I need uh my record shows I was getting a certain uh, moisture to put in my, my eyes on a daily basis and uh, I was buying it oo over the counter but I, I wanna try to get it uh sent to [PHI-Personal] on a monthly basis. Can you check, check, check that?
Nurse: So it's a, it's a um eye drop that you were using before.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was being sent to
Nurse: [PHI-Personal]. Ok. Let [PHI-Personal] look at your list because you don't have any eye drops on there currently that's active.
Patient: It's not active. Now, [PHI-Personal] asked [PHI-Personal] about it and II I told her I'd get it over the counter but uh no, I I need to have that just sent to [PHI-Personal] by express
Nurse: Scripts. Ok? I'm looking here. [PHI-Personal] let [PHI-Personal] go back to [PHI-Personal] note to see if she mentioned it one second.
Patient: She mentioned the last time we talked.
Nurse: Oh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I just wasn't there when you talked. So I just wanted to see if she put it in the note in the last note that you guys uh that you guys had um ver patient has eye ointment and antihistamine over the counter. No Rx needed. Yeah, she didn't. She just said that you had an eye ointment. So let [PHI-Personal] and eye ointment that that's really vague. Let [PHI-Personal] see. Do you remember the name of the ointment? That you were using. No,
Patient: That's the problem. She mentioned it and I told her no. And I should have said yes. But the, the have [PHI-Personal] call [PHI-Personal] back on that if you can't find or check with doctor and she should have it in, in her
Nurse: File. Ok, I'll do that. Ok.
Patient: Yeah, I, I need to get that, uh, set up to come, come on a monthly basis from express scripts. Ok. I'll,
Nurse: I'll see because she said it was, uh, it says over the counter, no prescription needed. So I'm not even seeing it on here. So, um, I'll keep looking and see if there's any place here where I can find it, but I'm not seeing it right now and she didn't even mention the name, she just said over the counter. Eye drops. No prescription needed.
Patient: What I'm getting is clear eyes, uh, o over over the counter and it's not that good long, long term. So I need to get to get a prescription. It's a little stronger.
Nurse: Oh, you need a new prescription? You're looking for a new prescription for something stronger. Ok, I'll, I'll make note of that because to get a new prescription you're gonna have to have a doctor's appointment, but you have one scheduled. So I'll make note that you want a new prescription for something strong over the counter.
Patient: I've already had my eye exam already
Nurse: This year. Oh, ok. And did the eye doctor give you some something prescription strength for it or did he just say the clear eyes?
Patient: He, he just, I did, he asked [PHI-Personal] what I was taking for the clear eyes. He said, ok, my eyes were fine. That's what he said.
Nurse: Oh, ok.
Patient: But doctor [PHI-Personal] has the results of that, of that eye exam?
Nurse: Ok. And it said it was fine but you need something for them anyway.
Patient: Well, I don't want to keep buying clear eyes. Ok, I, I want to get a
Nurse: Prescription. Ok. Ok. Um I can, I'll send a message over and see if she can give a prescription for it. And I'll also keep looking in your chart for any prescription, eye drop that you had prior to, to see if you know they can uh fill that one. I'm not sure if insurance that will pay for an over the counter eye drop, but I'll send a message to see if there's, well, it, it,
Patient: It, it, it, it, it was a result of the operation uh, on my, they put those lenses
Nurse: In there. Ok.
Patient: Yeah, it was just all of that so the insurance should cover
Nurse: It. Ok. Um, let [PHI-Personal], let [PHI-Personal] see what, what I can say or do to, to because you know it's not much to go off of. You need eye drops. The eye exam said you were fine and you, you, you need a prescription for over the counter eye drops. So I'll see what message I can send over to Doctor [PHI-Personal] and see if there's anything she can do.
Patient: I'd like it delivered. Not, not get that to run to the, uh, to the pharmacist every month. That's what I was trying to say.
Nurse: Yeah. If I'm able to find it, what I'm saying is this, if I'm able to find any type of eye drop in your list of medications, I can send a prescription refill for that. But if you're requesting a new medication altogether, we can't give you, you can't get a new medication without having a provider visit and your provider visit is next month. So I'm saying if you, if, if you're asking for a new prescription of something, then it's gonna have to wait until your new appointment. You have enough, you have enough eye drops to last you until your appointment. If you're requesting a new one. Now, if I can find the eye drops that you were using prior, I can just send a request over. You know what I mean?
Patient: I know I know go ahead to try to do that, but II, I won't be seeing the eye doctor again until next year.
Nurse: Ok. Yeah. Ok. All right. So, are you having any itchy eyes or anything like that? So when I ask her for the, uh, medication, she'll, she'll ask, ok, what is, what symptoms is the patient having? Are you co what I get
Patient: Is dry eyes? I, I just, uh, uh, what, what do they call that in your eyes when your eyes are dry? A little, I forget what they call it, but it, my eyes are dry in the morning. If I, if I, if I forget and I, I should, should take those eye drops twice a day. If I get, forget to take them at night. I have a problem in the morning, uh, with my eye. Ok.
Nurse: Ok. Got you, Got you. Got you. Ok. So um just to confirm, we're good to go on um the appointment. We're gonna send a message over to see if there's any orders or labs that need to be sent prior to the appointment. We're gonna let her know you're having dry eyes and you're using the clear eyes, but you'd like to have something sent via express uh scripts over to the house. Um Is that, is that everything, does that cover everything
Patient: As much as I can think of?
Nurse: I, I don't, I don't wanna miss a beat.
Patient: Yeah, I, I think it does.
Nurse: Thank you. You're welcome dear. Ok, so let [PHI-Personal] get to work on this and then um we'll talk soon. Ok.
Patient: All right. Thank you very much if you miss [PHI-Personal], leave [PHI-Personal] a message.
Nurse: Ok. Ok, not a problem. Thank you. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Thank you. You have a
Patient: Blessed day. Bye bye.
Nurse: You too now. Bye bye.
