Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you? Uh This is
Patient: [PHI-Personal] Loan. I got a call that I'm supposed to call this number back.
Nurse: Oh, right. Let me pull your chart up here, [PHI-Personal]. Right. Just to let you know the calls being recorded for quality purposes. But doctor [PHI-Personal] wanted me to call you and go over the care management program. And what that is is where a nurse would be calling you and checking in on you making sure everything's going well, see if you have any questions or concerns in between your visits. Also, she can assist with anything like medication refills, appointment, labs results, anything that pertains to your health and she reports back to the doctor on a monthly basis. It is a billable service to Medicare, Medicare Advantage and secondary insurance carriers. So it's subject to deductibles, co insurances and copays. You could receive a statement from the practice. So when would be a good time that the nurse could reach out to you morning or afternoon?
Patient: I do have a nurse coming once the year from [PHI-Geographic]. So I think I'm going to pass on this.
Nurse: Ok. Are you sure I mean, this isn't coming to your house. This is just checking in with you over the phone. This is just a little bit more, um, giving Doctor [PHI-Personal] a little, little more, um, info on the care and keeping in touch with you a little bit on month to month basis. Ah,
Patient: Well, I think I'd pass on it for right now.
Nurse: Ok. Is it all right if I send you a letter in the mail so that the doctor knows that I did reach out to you. Yeah. All right and your address still the eight Smoke House Lane. Apartment 2 16. Yeah. All right I'll get that out to you and let the doctor know and if you change your mind just give us a call. Ok. Ok. All right thank you.
Patient: Alright bye.
