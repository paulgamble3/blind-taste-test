Nurse: Thank you for calling [PHI-Geographic]. My name is [PHI-Personal]. How may I help you?
Patient: Yes, [PHI-Personal]. Uh, [PHI-Personal] you had just called me,
Nurse: Let me get you returning your call.
Patient: What I
Nurse: Said, let me get you pulled back up in my system.
Patient: Ok.
Nurse: All right. So the reason for my call today is Doctor [PHI-Personal] is providing a care management program that he thought that you could benefit from. And what that is, it's where a dedicated nurse will call you in between office visits. She'll provide you with any assistance on your current health conditions. She can help with medications, lab results and community resources. The care nurse will call check in, see how you're doing. Make sure everything's going ok and that you're doing well and while she's on the phone, she'll document your responses and provide a direct report to doctor [PHI-Personal]. These reports. Help Doctor [PHI-Personal] to stay up to date on your wellbeing. And if he sees anything of concern, he'll make sure it does get addressed right away. This will not replace your office visits with Doctor [PHI-Personal], but it does help him to be able to perform a more comprehensive office visit. When those do occur, the whole purpose of the program is to make sure that you are staying as safe and healthy as possible. And between your office visits, the program is a available service with [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] Advantage and secondary insurances. It's considered an office visit. So it may be subject to coinsurance, deductibles, and copays. I do see that you have [PHI-Personal] and Capital [PHI-Personal]. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes. Mhm. So
Nurse: With traditional [PHI-Personal], it covers 80% of the cost of the program while that remaining 20% will go to your secondary insurance. And the nurse can reach out either once a month, once every two months, every three months or every six months. And then you also have the option of being able to reach out to your care nurse any time that you have questions about your health needed, any help with prescription refills or prescription costs and she can also help with setting up appointments, rescheduling appointments and she can help expedite appointments. And like I said, this is just an added benefit to making sure that you're staying as safe and healthy as possible in between your office visits with doctor [PHI-Personal]. Ok. Would you prefer morning or afternoon calls from the care management nurse
Patient: Uh afternoon? Ok. Did you want to start with this a month? Cost me? This is not gonna cost me anything you said
Nurse: Correct? Um So [PHI-Personal] will cover that 80% and the remaining 20% will go to your secondary insurance and looking here, um, it doesn't look like that you do have a copay when you go to the office. So, um, the program's cost is going to be the same as doctor [PHI-Personal] in the office.
Patient: Ohh. Ok.
Nurse: Did you want to start with once a month for the phone calls or once every couple of months?
Patient: Ohh. And let's start
Nurse: And you can address that call frequency at any time with your care nurse and you can opt out at any point and then I'll be sending you out some additional information. It will be a welcome letter to the program and it will have your nurses contact information in there is the [PHI-Geographic] and [PHI-Personal]. Hi. Still a good mailing address for
Patient: You and it is [PHI-Geographic]. Yes. Yes. Yes, that's my address. Yes. So
Nurse: I'll send out that additional information. Um, and like I said, it will have your nurses contact information and then she'll reach out to you within the next couple of weeks to touch base and introduce herself. Ok.
Patient: Ok.
Nurse: Do you have any questions? No. All right. Well, I'll get this information sent out to you today. Ok.
Patient: Ok.
Nurse: All right. Well, thank you so much for returning my call and I hope that you have a wonderful rest of your day today.
Patient: Ok. Thank you and same to you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye bye.
