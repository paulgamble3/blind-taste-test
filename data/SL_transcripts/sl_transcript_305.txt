Patient: No it's um no I don't want him in I'm trying [PHI-Account] get hours and I need the doctor [PHI-Account] recommend him for more hours because you got [PHI-Account] have 14 hours and I'm the one that has [PHI-Account] be his caretaker in the middle of the day and it's killing me and I can't do it um I'm doing it but it's it's hurting me really bad so um yeah if you can give me who what time is that appointment? The
Nurse: [PHI-Personal] on the [PHI-Personal]? Yeah.

Nurse: Yeah that was just the earliest appointment we could get [PHI-Account] [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Account] get him in there [PHI-Account] get some hours.
Patient: I'm gonna [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Account] get him in there. He has a caregiver from 6 30 [PHI-Account] 7 [PHI-Account] 8 [PHI-Account] 9 on in the morning. So I have [PHI-Account], um, I don't know, I'll, I'll make it, I'll find some way [PHI-Account] do it. Um, now we
Nurse: Can go the, now looking after that the earliest would be [PHI-Personal] 27th.
Patient: No, that's too late. I want him [PHI-Account] come soon. He's got [PHI-Account] have those hours. Um, and I need [PHI-Account] know if, if sunshine, well, I can ask them tomorrow if they are in the pro in the, um, live with, um, as a provider, with Doctor [PHI-Personal], as a provider and [PHI-Personal] because I don't wanna change doctors, you know, I wanna keep him. Oh, my gosh. All right. So 8 30 I'll call, I have plenty of time [PHI-Account] call the squad and get them here early enough [PHI-Account] pick him up because I have [PHI-Account] do a wheelchair thing.
Nurse: Ok. So you want [PHI-Account] keep, and you want [PHI-Account] keep the, the right.
Patient: Right. And if I can't make it, I'll call you. But we're, we're gonna go for that. Ok. Ok.
Nurse: Yeah, because I just don't want it [PHI-Account] be even further out for him. Now, this is what the, the physician's assistant because, I mean, uh, from the doctor office there, but that was the earliest. So maybe we can get some help for him. Ok. So
Patient: She can tell him that he needs the hours. Right. And he'll, she should be,
Nurse: She should be able [PHI-Account], she [PHI-Personal] even be able [PHI-Account] prescribe those. I'm not entirely sure how that works. But uh that would be our best. I think our best bet. Now, um I know before you had mentioned having some anxiety, how are you doing? Are you still,
Patient: Uh I'm still having the anxiety. My hands are so broken out with a rash from, from trying, I'm allergic [PHI-Account] the gloves that they sent me. Um, that I'm having a problem with that company because, and that's why I wanted [PHI-Account] find out if you order the products or if the nurse practitioner did because they won't talk [PHI-Account] me. They said, oh, you can't tell us, we have [PHI-Account] have it from your doctor. So, because I called him, I said you sent the wrong size diaper and they won't change it. They're sending him extra large diapers when he needs a large,
Nurse: I don't think that since they've, since he's not been seen in our office, I doubt that they're the ones that have ordered
Patient: It. Ok, because they called office and they didn't do it. And I've got, I had one visit from a home doctor because I thought she was in the plan and then I found out she's not in the plan. I'm gonna get a bill for her. So it's like, but I think she ordered them. I just can't get her on the phone. I'll [PHI-Personal] again. That's what that lady was calling you about. Ok. Yeah, that,
Nurse: Yeah, it, it would, I would almost have [PHI-Account] be one of the other providers because since he's not been seen in the office, I don't see anything here.
Patient: Ok, good. And, um, I'll tell the girls [PHI-Account] tomorrow I'm gonna find out if doctor is in that plan. So she should bring my daughter. Really is the one that set this up and she should have checked on it because I'm not changing doctors again. Mhm. I'm happy with doctor. I've had him before. He's great and I just need [PHI-Account] get my husband [PHI-Account] him because I know he'll give him the attention he needs.
Nurse: Now, are you now regarding you, your anxiety, your rash and everything, would you like [PHI-Account], [PHI-Account] have an appointment? Yeah, I have 1 [PHI-Personal]. But would you like an earlier appointment [PHI-Account] go check these things out?
Patient: Yeah. If uh, if Doctor [PHI-Personal] had or the nurse practitioner, I, I'm coming there on the [PHI-Personal]. Can they see me like an hour later? Some?
Nurse: Um, I'll look but I'm, it's kind of prior. It's hard where they, uh, I know, let me see if I can cancel. Now. There's one with Doctor [PHI-Personal] on the [PHI-Personal] of [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Ok. Give me that one. Who's doctor? Is he new?
Nurse: No, he's actually not gonna be in the office for, uh, much longer. I think he's leaving. But, um, or there's one, now there is one the [PHI-Personal] at [PHI-Personal] o'clock. That's [PHI-Personal]. I'm sorry. That's [PHI-Personal]. Um, so would you rather have the [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] 1 with doctor?
Patient: Um, yeah, I guess he's just gonna report [PHI-Account] Doctor [PHI-Personal], right? Yeah, they'll
