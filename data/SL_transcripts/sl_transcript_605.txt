Nurse: Care Management. This is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal] calling. You left me a voice mail?
Nurse: Oh, yes. How are you? Fine, good. Uh, so I was just reaching out to give you information about the care management program that the doctors are offering. Um, and so what that, um, what that program involves is the doctors would have a care management nurse, uh, just giving you a follow up phone call in between your office visits with her. So she'll call once every two months, um, just to check in, see how everything's going. Um, she'll ask if there's anything that needs to be addressed or discussed, such as if there were any issues that might have come up in between those appointments. Um, any concerns that you might have been having or just questions in general that she can help you with. Um, and she also goes over any kind of medications that you might be on and she'll just ask you things like how they're working for you or if there's any issues or problems with any of them and then if you need refills, she'll also call and get them refilled for you as well. Alright. All right. Um and then she does go back and report everything to your doctor after every follow up call just so they could be made aware of anything that does go on in between those appointments. Um just so they can better manage your health and making sure you're staying as healthy as possible. Does that sound like something you would participate in? No, no. Ok. Well, thank you very much for returning my call and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. All right, you too. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye bye.
