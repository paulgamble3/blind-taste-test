Nurse: This is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you? Yeah, [PHI-Personal], this is [PHI-Personal]. Hi, Miss [PHI-Personal]. How you doing today? Oh, well, I'm doing all right. What's going on? How can I help you? Well, um, I would like life alert. Could you help me with that?
Patient: That's a great question. I can certainly try. Uh, let me do a little bit of research on it and see how I would go about ordering that for you or at least sending the request to the doctor.
Nurse: Yeah. Um, yeah, because I called up the step, but they want me to come up there and I just can't do that yet. You know, I can go on a walker but I can't drive yet just yet. So I wondered if you could help me.
Patient: Well, I can certainly try. Um, let me see. Uh, let me talk to, uh, the office and see if it has to be done by a provider. Um, if so I'll have them submit the order, but I'm pretty sure it's just a matter of the patient calling and requesting. But let me find out and I'll call you back. Ok. Ok. Thank you all Right, my dear. Ok, bye bye.
