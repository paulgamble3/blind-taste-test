Nurse: Good morning. This is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: [PHI-Personal]. This is [PHI-Personal]. Hi. Um [PHI-Personal] called Friday said I can't get my braces because [PHI-Personal] never put it on the paper that it was medically necessary. So they denied me my claim for my braces for my knees. So [PHI-Personal], does she have to send another one in and fax it or what? Because I call, try to call her office and it don't answer. They're busy.
Nurse: Ok. Um, well, let me, um, I'll call [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Geographic] and see if maybe we can, um, send in, um, like an addendum to that note maybe and go ahead and get that sent in. But I'll go ahead and call [PHI-Personal] and see what needs to be done. And, uh, I'll send in a priority message for you and get that rolling. And then, yeah,
Patient: Because I, they called me and told me they denied it Friday because it, it said it wasn't necessary. Now, listen, I went to Doctor [PHI-Personal], I told me I called [PHI-Personal]. I told him I went to Doctor [PHI-Personal] office. He's, uh, uh, uh, uh, a knee doctor and he told me he won't operate because I have afib and they won't operate because I'm diabetic. So I said they won't, they can't, you know, so I have, it isn't that I can't walk without the knee braces. I'm gonna have to have them because I can't walk. I wanna be able to walk yet yet for a couple more years. I'm gonna be [PHI-Personal] soon in August. So I said I want, I really need the braces and if they don't wanna help me with them, you know, I don't know what I'm gonna do and uh and uh uh Medi [PHI-Personal] said is because your doctor didn't put on there that was medically necessary. Ok? And she said the doctor has to put it on the paper when they send the prescription in.
Nurse: Ok? So if, if, if,
Patient: If, if uh [PHI-Personal] could please do that, could you please get a hold of her and have her, you know, send it in and, and make sure that she puts on there that it's medically necessary or they won't. She said [PHI-Personal] said they'll cover it 80% of it and the county would pick up the rest if, if only she puts that on there that it's medically necessary.
Nurse: So. Ok. Alrighty. Well, I'll get um, I'll go ahead and send her a message and then I will call and confirm with [PHI-Personal] what all what needs to be said on it or? Ok, and then
Patient: [PHI-Personal] can get back to me whenever she's out something
Nurse: Mhm. Yeah. Ok I'll get working on that
Patient: For you. You gotta do that soon. Yeah
Nurse: I'm gonna go ahead and start working on it for you. Thank you very much uh you're welcome I hope you have a good day. Ok? You too bye. Mhm. Thank you bye.
