Nurse: [PHI-Geographic]. This is how can I help you?
Patient: This is just I knew, I think of my question that B 12 uh tablet that I'm taking, am I supposed to be taking 1000 mg a day? I, I took one or two because I have 500 mg pills.
Nurse: Yes, I have that. You're taking 1000 micrograms every day? Ok. Ok.
Patient: And when, when would you suggest taking the vitamins? Like not, you don't take the B 12 and the D three together, you take them at different times, right?
Nurse: Um I don't first, I don't think that was gonna be an issue. They shouldn't interfere with each other. Um I think probably the best time to take them is on an empty stomach so they absorb the best. So. Really?
Patient: Yeah.
Nurse: Yes. Yes. So I think um maybe, I mean depending on how much you eat at night time, you know, if your stomach is fairly empty before bed, you could always take them before bedtime um or before breakfast.
Patient: Yeah. Ok. I, I take my uh thyroid pill before breakfast but one of my friends that told me she takes her. So the last time she gets up to, to go to the bathroom at night and she said that way you can eat, you know, it don't hurt to feed or not after that. Yeah, that's fine. Oh,
Nurse: No, that's fine. That's ok. I'm glad you remembered your question.
Patient: Well, when I went over and I thought I just got them out because I had put them away. So I wouldn't take them before I went to the hospital. I wasn't to take them for two weeks.
Nurse: Oh yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yup, I would uh it looks like your your schedule or you're prescribed for 1000 on here. Ok then. So. Alrighty. Well you have a good evening. Thank you. Alright bye bye bye
Patient: Bye.
