They're gonna send me to another TG. And I don't want, I don't wanna be spreading myself. I rather keep it inconclusive to where I'm being treated anyway. I call you and of course, you know how they be, you gotta wait for them to return the call. I was just calling to see if you can email them and let them know that I need to schedule an appointment because it takes like up to, she said 3 S3 days, 72 hours. And that, that's a lot, that's a long time. Um,

Nurse: Thank you, my love. Yeah, you're welcome.
