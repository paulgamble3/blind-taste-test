Well, she is participating in a care management and behavior management program that she thinks that you can benefit from. Ok. All right. And the program is just when um like a nurse will just call and check in on you in between your office visits, answer any kind of questions or concerns that you might have with your current health conditions. She can assist you with your medications, um such as medication refills, she can go over your medicines with you. Um, prescription cost reductions, lab and test results as well as community resources and it's just designed to try to keep the doctor more up to date on your well being in between your office visits. Ok. And what do you do every six months or so unless you have something to come up? Ok. Ok. And so the programs um are billable to Medicare, Medicare advantage and secondary insurances. So it can be considered an office visit and may be subjected to a copay, deductible and co insurance. But you have the [PHI-Personal] up MC Community Health choice. So you don't have a copay, do you?
