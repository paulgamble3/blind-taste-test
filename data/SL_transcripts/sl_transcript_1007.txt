Nurse: This is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you?
Patient: Hi. Um, my name is, [PHI-Personal] I was [PHI-Personal] that was contacted by, um, um, uh, Doctor [PHI-Personal] office about the, um, new care management program. Yes. Ok. And I got the letter [PHI-Personal] I just read it [PHI-Personal], um, I know there was a cost, the monthly charge involved in it, but there's no mention of it in the, the letter. So I wanted to, to get a little bit more information on it if I can.
Nurse: Ok. Yeah. So it looks like the copay is, um, well, you have Medicare as your primary [PHI-Personal] Medicare normally doesn't have a copay for it, but your secondary insurance says there's a $20 copay. Do you have a copay when you go to the doctor's office?
Patient: If I go to the GP, it's only $[PHI-Personal].
Nurse: Ok. It's normally the same as a doctor's appointment visit, um, for the calls. Now, we have you listed as inbound only, which means we wouldn't be calling you, you just call in if you need any help or have any questions.
Patient: Ok. All right. Um, would that, ok, give a, a recent, a current, um, yesterday I woke up [PHI-Personal], uh, my eye was all gunked up [PHI-Personal] I, I babysit two of my grandchildren. Um, I, I get everything that going down the pike [PHI-Personal], um, I wondered if it was, um, pink Eye. Ok, which would influence whether I go to babysit or not [PHI-Personal] I made an appointment for today. Now, the thing is I live in [PHI-Geographic]. Ok. And, ok, uh, under those circumstances that I just mentioned, uh, would the, um, uh, care management be something that would be handled that way or does it require an appointment?
Nurse: You, you would have to have an appointment to be seen for that because you're most likely gonna need, if it's pink eye, you're most likely gonna need medication for it. Um, whereas we, like, you would call us [PHI-Personal] tell us your symptoms [PHI-Personal] we would say you need to be seen. Ok, it's just kinda here if you have any questions, anything like that in regards to your health, your medications, anything like that, you had your appointment [PHI-Personal] you have questions about your appointment, you had a specialist appointment, you have questions about your specialist appointment. Um, it's, it's a lot of stuff like that. Like if you have questions about stuff, we can educate you [PHI-Personal] give you some, you know, guidance on things like that. Um, but in a case like that where it sounds like you have pink eye, you would absolutely need to be seen in order to get like a medication to treat
Patient: It. Ok. All right, because it, it, it seems like, well, I'm, I'm trying to get out of the gray area. Um, what is covered [PHI-Personal] what is [PHI-Personal] right. Ok. Um, [PHI-Personal] now if I didn't get it, uh, now see I get contacted by Optum Rx that I need a refill [PHI-Personal] I, I would, they call you guys under those circumstances to get the the refill? Right now, how would that change if I have the caregiver?
Nurse: So you could um instead of calling the office, you could call us [PHI-Personal] we would be able to, you know, you wouldn't have to go through like the receptionist [PHI-Personal] wait for this like you would call [PHI-Personal] you would get [PHI-Personal] of our nurses [PHI-Personal] then we would help you directly with whatever it is you needed.
Patient: Ok. Right. And ok. So if I, if I sign up for this. Mhm. Now do I get billed every month or how is uh
Nurse: You get billed for when you get the calls? And you don't have to get calls every month if you want us to call every other month, if you want us to call every three months, um we can do that [PHI-Personal] then in the interim, if you had any questions or concerns, you could always reach out to us in between those calls.
Patient: Ok. Right. And you would bill [PHI-Personal] um I think they, I think who I talked to said something about eight, do $8 a month or, or something like that. I, I didn't write everything down. Ok. Is, is that what it is or is it only when you use it or it's
Nurse: When you use it
Patient: When I use it? Ok. And then you would send me a bill for when I use it [PHI-Personal] I would pay that
Nurse: Right? Like you get like a copay for when you use it. Ok. And then like your frequency of calls, we could always do whatever you wanted [PHI-Personal] we can even, we could even change it. So if you started out [PHI-Personal] you wanted us to call you every three months, we could do that. And then if you think, well, you know, I'm doing pretty good, maybe I can, you know, make it every six months, we can switch it to every six months or if you feel like you need to be called more, then we could always, you know, we call you every two months instead. Like we can change the frequency of how we call you up to however you want us to.
Patient: Ok. All right. Oh, no offense. But, [PHI-Personal] it's pain now, you know, with age. All right. Mhm. Things do change [PHI-Personal], um, but it, it, ok, I'll be, I, I, I'm a real blunt [PHI-Personal] honest person. Ok. I'll, you know, but it seems that I can get all those things without doing the copay [PHI-Personal] things like that. Now, if I was older [PHI-Personal], um, I do take a lot of medications but my labs have been great. So good. Yeah. So I think for my age I'm, I'm doing well. Good. Good. Yeah.
Nurse: So, [PHI-Personal] that's fine [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] we can just leave it as if you ever have any questions that you need, answered about your health or anything that, you know, you need, you could always just give us a call as needed or if you're having a hard time getting a hold of the office, you can call us, but we don't have to call you if you don't want us to.
Patient: Yeah,
Nurse: It's just an option that's there for you. If you change your mind in the future, we can always do it. Um, or we're always just here for you to call in if you have any, any questions or concerns in between anything.
Patient: Oh, yeah, it is right now. I don't think I've reached the point. The, you know, I come in to see guys like every 3 to 6 months [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal], you know, I get labs done [PHI-Personal] things like that, make sure that I'm, uh, you know, on the straight [PHI-Personal] narrow [PHI-Personal] so. Yeah.
Nurse: Well, [PHI-Personal] it's, yeah, it sounds like you're in pretty good health [PHI-Personal] you've got a pretty good handle on what's going on. Like I said, if it ever changes in the future, we can start calling you, but we can just leave it as, you know, if you ever have an issue, concern, you can always reach out [PHI-Personal] we can help you with, with it, whatever it is. Ok.
Patient: Ok. There's no contract to sign or anything like that. Right.
Nurse: Right.
Patient: All right. Well, you've answered a lot of my questions [PHI-Personal] I do appreciate that. I appreciate honesty [PHI-Personal] time [PHI-Personal] absolutely, you know, I, I know I'm getting older but, uh, as my [PHI-Personal] year old granddaughter says, you don't act like my grandmothers [PHI-Personal] I, you couldn't tell me anything better then because I've given up on birthdays. I just had the anniversary [PHI-Personal] I have the 22nd anniversary of my 50th birthday.
Nurse: Ok. See, that makes sense.
Patient: Yeah. You know. Right. Laugh about it [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] things like that, you know, [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] I try to keep up on my regular, you know, I get all my inoculations [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] good things like that [PHI-Personal] I see a cardiologist [PHI-Personal], you know,
Nurse: Good. Well, if anything changes in the future, you can always reach out. Ok.
Patient: Ok. Thank you very much [PHI-Personal] I do very much appreciate your time.
Nurse: You're welcome. You have a good rest of your day
Patient: [PHI-Personal] I'll be there at [PHI-Personal] o'clock.
Nurse: Ok.
Patient: Ok. Bye.
