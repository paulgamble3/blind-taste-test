Nurse: This is
Patient: [PHI-Personal]. Hi, [PHI-Personal]. This is [PHI-Personal]. Oh,
Nurse: Good morning, good morning, Miss, I called you earlier. Thanks for returning my call. I received your message about, um, a change in your medication,
Patient: Right? I mean, this medication is, uh, it's really not working. I mean, it helps me stay awake. Don't get me wrong. I mean, it just, you know, it helps me, but I'm just like, it's causing headaches. I'm getting muscle cramps, like unbelievable muscle cramps, which is crazy because when I, I was doing physical therapy and they kept saying, why, why are you cramping up so bad? And I said, I don't know, I said I started a new medication and according [PHI-Geographic] what they looked up and what, you know, I saw it can, that's one of the side effects. It can cause muscle cramps. So, um, between the headaches and the muscle cramps, uh, you know, it, it's not working, it's having more side effects on me, you know, and I know I see the doctor next week but, you know, I don't know if you wanna say something and I don't, you know, know if I know I have [PHI-Geographic] go in for, I think around next week I probably could do another blood test for my thyroid cause I really still don't think my thyroid is working. So, between medication and thyroid, you know, I, I don't know what [PHI-Geographic] do.
Nurse: Are you experiencing any symptoms with your thyroid issues?
Patient: Uh, how can I tell? Bye, bye.
Nurse: I'm mainly extra tired.
Patient: Yeah, I'm tired. I've been saying this for months when I gained weight and, you know, when I was taking the Adderall, I was ok. But I, you know, that's when he, he put me on the time release. Well, now there's an Adderall shortage. So that's why we switched medication and, um, you know, uh, it's just, I've been, he has changed my thyroid medication, I think three times now. Mhm. So, and I know he's got [PHI-Geographic] get the right dosage. But, you know, um, as far as symptoms for thyroid, yes, I'm tired. Um, yeah, I, I, you know, what are the other symptoms
Nurse: Or changes?
Patient: Weight gain? Mood change? Pardon me?
Nurse: I say mood changes feel, feeling like you're forgetful or, um, losing your train of thought or at loss for words.
Patient: Yeah, sometimes, you know, I mean, not, you know, not all the time. Yeah, I'm pretty, you know, I, I have my days but I'm also [PHI-Personal]. So. Ok.
Nurse: Yes, ma'am. Ok. So I will let him know and the medication is the new vision, correct? Pardon me? Um, you say he switched your [PHI-Personal] the, um, the medication? Ok. That's the new visual. Yeah.
Patient: Yeah, he switched that last time I saw him. So, I have been on it since. See, because it didn't come. What [PHI-Personal]? No, no, no, he switched this medication. Oh, I've been on this since. What's the date? Well, [PHI-Account] 01, I've been on it since. Ok.
Nurse: Yeah. And since you have the headache, is it, are the symptoms every day or is it every other day or how often do you experience that? Um,
Patient: The headache, I wouldn't say every day, it just, they come and go sometimes, or, you know, I get them like three days in a row. Sometimes I don't get them at all. But, um, the, the cramping, uh, uh, at least once a day in my leg or my back or my arm and, you know, but mostly my legs, my legs are definitely is what the issue is with getting like a Charlie horse, you know, that type of cramping. And, uh, and when I would, like I said, when I was doing physical therapy, there were certain things that they had me do and the minute I did it, it was like, I would cramp up and they go, that is so odd and, and they were even stumped, you know. So, but, yeah, I, I mean, I can re laying in bed, I can stretch and all of a sudden I'm like jumping out of bed with a, you know, bad [PHI-Personal] horse.
Nurse: Have you? I see you were want, were you, are you still taking magnesium? Yeah, I, I think that could be related [PHI-Geographic] that as well because I'm looking, well,
Patient: Your cardiologist put me on the magnesium.
Nurse: Ok. Have he, has he assessed you since then? Because sometimes when you have too little magnesium, they could also cause the cramping.
Patient: Um, no, he hasn't affected me since then. No.
Nurse: So that's something um doctor, he can also run a lab [PHI-Geographic] check for that since you are complaining I can still put that in a complaint and maybe he can go ahead and asses you for your magnesium levels as well. Right? Because I was trying [PHI-Geographic] put the symptoms together. I was like, I don't see cramping as a side effect. The headache is for sure, but the cramping that was throwing me off and I, I was looking through your meds. I saw that magnesium.
Patient: Right. Yeah, I mean, you know, I take, I take calcium, I take vitamin D. Mm. You know, um I take vitamins, multivitamins. Um, you know, I, I take some other supplements um like, uh you know, omega, I take that it just, and I took all these before and I had no issues other than, you know, the weight gain and the tiredness. But I've been, you know, I, I've been complaining about the weight gain since what, six months ago, nine months ago. Almost a year now, I've been complaining about that and, you know, he, and he said, you know, exercise of course, in dieting and things like that. But then my, you know, my labs, my labs for my thyroid are so off. Mhm. You know, I figured that's probably gonna have something [PHI-Geographic] do with
Nurse: It. Yes, ma'am. They could also all that ties in together. Hopefully, once we get you in, we can get you some labs drawn [PHI-Geographic] check your thyroid levels [PHI-Geographic] check your magnesium level. Just [PHI-Geographic] see where this muscle cramping is coming from. It could be either of those just [PHI-Geographic] be honest. So you have [PHI-Geographic] run the labs [PHI-Geographic] see if you think that you do have that appointment coming up is going
Patient: [PHI-Geographic] next week. But yeah, if you look at my past thyroid lab. Mhm. From, yeah. Well, God, it's gotta be 36906, [PHI-Account]. Um, [PHI-Personal]. It, I mean, it's gotta be like I said, it's gotta be nine months of cha of, you know, he's been changing my thyroid medicine, you know, I've gone uh from, I think I'm on one of my life. A very low dose right now [PHI-Account] [PHI-Geographic]
Nurse: [PHI-Personal]. Pardon me? Yes, it was changed [PHI-Geographic] [PHI-Personal] in [PHI-Personal],
Patient: Right? That's when he changed it, right?
Nurse: Ok. So I will send a message [PHI-Geographic] him just [PHI-Geographic] let him know everything that's going on. So when you go [PHI-Geographic] that visit. He should have a re something idea of what's going on with you, but maybe when you go, you can go into further detail, but I'm gonna send him a message, let him know everything that's going on and request some labs. So I might be giving you a call [PHI-Geographic] let you know [PHI-Geographic] go in early so you can get your labs taken and that way he can discuss it while you're there. Right? Ok. Right. So, does this sound like a plan?
Patient: Yeah, sounds like, explain [PHI-Geographic] me. Just remember I'm in [PHI-Geographic]. So if you want me [PHI-Geographic] do labs, you know, um, just what? Get them done. So, you know,
Nurse: And do you wanna go [PHI-Geographic] the clinic [PHI-Geographic] get them done or have them sent [PHI-Geographic] Lab Corp or any other lab?
Patient: Um, depends on what day. Let's see what, let me see what my schedule is. Honestly, I got a crazy schedule going on right now.
Nurse: Uh, just let me know and I can, according [PHI-Geographic] your schedule,
Patient: Um, I guess, uh, Monday, I have [PHI-Geographic] go [PHI-Geographic] [PHI-Geographic] for a follow up for them. So if I could get lab work, I don't know. How quickly does he get labs back? I mean, I can come [PHI-Geographic] your office on Monday the 23rd, Monday
Nurse: Is fine. I'm not sure if all the labs will be in by then, but if whatever lab that isn't in, he can always give you a call. I send you a message in my chart. Right? Yeah, so it's 2 30. Your appointment is gonna be 2 30. So they may be in by that time if you do the day before. Yeah, I

Nurse: Oh my goodness. So it's very busy.
Patient: Oh, I don't I don't know if that's a being why I'm so overtired, but I am just, I'm exhausted and I, you know, I, I know, I, I don't know if it's this medication but like I said, I feel it just, I don't feel myself, I don't feel right. Ok. And I don't know if it's the medication he's got me on or if it's my thyroid. But I am just, I drag.
Nurse: Mhm. And that's the thyroid. It is the thyroid. So hope we have [PHI-Geographic] get it. Hopefully, once we get these labs, he can adjust it and it makes all the difference,
