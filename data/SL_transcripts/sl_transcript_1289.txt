Nurse: Hi. Hello, this is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Actually, this is [PHI-Personal]. How are you doing?
Nurse: Good. How are you doing?
Patient: Oh, I'm doing ok. Hey, uh, you remember I had that, uh, an ultrasound or whatever you call it, uh, on my stomach, uh, [PHI-Personal] end of January I think is [PHI-Personal] 27. But [PHI-Personal] results come back, February [PHI-Personal] first. Ok. Well, um, I talked to somebody and you weren't there. You were on vacation or some place. I don't know what, anyway, uh, she told me that I would probably get, uh, from, I would get a, uh, request to have another blood test done. And then after that they'll probably send me to a liver doctor. But, uh, but I have contacted office twice since then and that and they have yet to send me anything. I told them I'd come down and pick it up if they just let me know. So I'm kind of at a loss for it. Uh, uh, anyway, I didn't know, I, I think about getting this report because [PHI-Personal], that cyst that's on my liver is about a one inch cyst. And, um, I didn't know, maybe I should take this out to [PHI-Personal] uh va and have them check me out or something, right?
Nurse: Um You know, that wouldn't hurt. I do see that you, your message that you talked to um Nicole uh last week. So, um I don't see that. I looked in here and I don't see any orders or anything like that set up, um, or sent out. So what I can do is I will, um, I can send her a message and have, you know, just say, hey, you know, just, you know, [PHI-Personal] still waiting on those, you know, orders, especially because you know, you wanna get those labs done um and get [PHI-Personal] ultrasound, you know, get that other ultrasound done as well. Um And see if she follows up, but I don't think it would hurt to take it up with [PHI-Personal] va and just kind of see um you know, if they can uh get you in any quicker and then I will definitely, because I think doctor will have to make out [PHI-Personal] referral for you to see [PHI-Personal] hepatologist, which is [PHI-Personal] liver specialist. Um So I am, I don't see that referral made yet, but I it doesn't look to me that doctor has um responded to your, to [PHI-Personal] message from Nicole. Um cause Nicole did ask her also to, to put those orders in so she could fax them over. So let me um send a follow up message and just see if we can get, you know, those sent out for you this week to [PHI-Personal] Lab Corp. Correct? Is that where you get your blood work done?
Patient: Yeah. Apparently [PHI-Personal] last time I had my blood work done, I had it done right there at office and she asked me said, you want, where, where do you want it done? Uh, I said, well, I been, uh, having it done at Lab Corp and she said, well, we can do it here now. So I said, well, I'll have it done there but whenever I talked to, uh, it wasn't Nicole, it was [PHI-Personal] girl at [PHI-Personal] front desk, she told me that, um, they stopped it, done it again. And so I guess I'll go to Lab Corp
Nurse: And then what about [PHI-Personal] ultrasound? Where do you get [PHI-Personal], where do you get your ultrasounds done
Patient: At? Well, I got my ultrasound. Uh, it's a Kumin. Does that make sense to you? Ok. I did it. Uh, yeah, it's on [PHI-Geographic]. Ok. Perfect. The one that I go to, she give me a whole list and it's about 67. Ok. Yes.
Nurse: Yes. I think it's pronounced like ac, a common, but I, I definitely am familiar with that. I sent some other, other, uh, patients there as well. So, yeah,
Patient: They did a great job. Good,
Nurse: Good. I'm glad you like them because I've heard good things about them from other people as well. Um, are you having any like pain or anything like that in your stomach, any, you know, fluid, uh, like swelling or anything like that.
Patient: Uh No, no, not that I know of. Oh yeah,
Nurse: I just wanna make sure cause sometimes you know, like when you have, uh, you know, like elevated or like, because you, you know, you had [PHI-Personal] cyst on your liver, I just wanna make sure it's not causing you like any pain or anything like that.
Patient: No, I, uh, no, I was talking to somebody. I guess it is a friend that, uh, um, was there [PHI-Personal] day that you weren't. I, I told her, I said it now and that for [PHI-Personal] past year or two, every now and then I get a pain that's only on [PHI-Personal] right hand side and [PHI-Personal] back I said, I always thought that it was kidney stone because I've had so many kidney stones and [PHI-Personal] last time that I had a, uh, operation where they went in, I heard they blasted it with [PHI-Personal] ultrasound or whatever it is. Um, he told me, he said that there's another one in your other kidney. But he said, unless it gets to bothering you, there's no point in messing with it. And, um, so I always thought that and this just happens maybe once every month or two and I'll get a pain or sharp pain back there. And so that's what I'll, and I always felt that that's what it was, yeah, and it goes away just in a little while. Ok. So, uh, so I've, you know, that's what I always thought that it was. And, uh, [PHI-Personal] doctor out at [PHI-Personal] va, he had it, I had my kidneys x-rayed or something. He sent me up for an x-ray. I told him about that and he said that, he said, no, he said, I don't think that there's any problem there. He said, I think that you just got a uh muscle back there that you strain every now and then
Nurse: And it kind of just give you that sharp pain there. OK.
Patient: Yeah. So, so I'm never having to give that any thought, but I don't know whether a like this could do anything like that or not.
Nurse: Um You know, it's, everybody's different and cysts are, I guess they like kind of react different in everybody's body. Sometimes they can cause pain. Um But other times mo and most of [PHI-Personal] time people don't even know that they're there because they don't cause any pain or anything like that. I think if they're growing and if they're getting large is when they start to cause pain because they start to maybe like, you know, press up on organs or things like that. Um But like I said, most of [PHI-Personal] time people don't even realize that they're there. Um Like you said, because they will, you know, get imaging done or like blood work or something is coming up abnormal. So then a provider will say, well, let's, you know, check it out in a little bit more detail. Um, but I would say that it's, um, a, a good sign that you're not having like any pain or anything like that, that, that would be like constant pain or something like that. Ok. But, um, I'll send this message out and see what, um, you know, we can get from them. I like also like you said, I don't think it would hurt anything if you did call [PHI-Personal] va and just say I had this imaging, they'll direct you too and say like no just you know, wait for your PC P or yeah, let's you know, get it taken care of and that kind of thing.
Patient: Yeah. Ok. Well I really appreciate [PHI-Personal] talk and uh did you get a Valentine today?
Nurse: I haven't yet but I know that my son said he has something for me brewing up so we'll see what he get get brings me home from school.
Patient: Ok? I hope he made those hand made [PHI-Personal]. They're so much better than they
Nurse: Are. They are. I love them,
Patient: But well you have a good day.
Nurse: Thank you so much [PHI-Personal] and then I'll follow up with you as soon as uh someone gets back with me from [PHI-Personal] office.
Patient: Ok.
Nurse: Thank you. Alright. You're welcome. You have a great day.
Patient: You too. Bye bye.
