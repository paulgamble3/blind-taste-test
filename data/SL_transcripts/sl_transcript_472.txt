But as I said, I live when I got there, they were most concerned about my heart rate, you know, they, that apparently that move out of whack or something. I don't know.
Nurse: Ok. Do you remember what your heart rate was.

Sorry. So, it looks like your urine came back. Did you get your results for that? Um it says your urine overall is unremarkable. Let's see how the frequency urinate, the uh urinary frequency responds to starting Myrbetriq. Ok. If any changes in symptoms, I would like a repeat urine. And what was your urine? The urine? Um, the overall urine culture is unremarkable, which is good, right? Which is good. She, he's um she said, let's see how the frequency responds to you. Taking my Myrbetriq, right? Um If any changes, yeah,
Patient: I'm good.

Patient: All right. I check that every day and I believe it goes to the doctor also. Yeah, every day. Mhm.
