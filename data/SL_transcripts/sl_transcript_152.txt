Nurse: Hi. Hello, this is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hello. Um, [PHI-Personal]. Yes.
Nurse: So I can hear you.
Patient: It's just weird. This is a totally different number. I just dialed it, uh, from what you usually owe for, uh, 29. Anyway, I, I can't get my spironolactone and, um, and they said trouble with the provider or, oh, every excuse keeps coming just like it was with the Janumet and I really need my spironolactone. I ordered it in plenty of time. It should not have had all this trouble. They said there was this wrong and that wrong. I am, I'm just understanding it. Not right. It says my provider, there's problems with the provider. Well, is that not my doctor? Yes. Ok. So I, I just, I, I just, I just tried to get them, uh, at the office and then they put me on hold and then you called in. So I, I just went to you. But, uh, I think this is, I don't know, I don't get it
Nurse: Right. I'm so sorry. I will call the pharmacy right now and see what's going on so that I can help. So it's the, um, Spirolactone with the Hydrochlorothiazide. Correct. The 25-25.
Patient: Ok, I've been doing it for years. Ok,
Nurse: So and then um to the Walgreens right? That's the pharmacy.
Patient: No, that's
Nurse: Ok. So let me call them right now and see what's going on and then I'll call you right back and let you know uh what they say and then I'll go ahead and request it for um, refills because it doesn't look like it's been requested at this time. So I'm gonna definitely call them right now and see what's
Patient: Going. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's really kind of crazy. Ok, thank you. Yeah,
Nurse: Absolutely. I'll call you
Patient: Back. Ok? Thanks.
