Nurse: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Care Management. My name is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I got, I received a phone call from you.
Nurse: Thank you, [PHI-Personal]. I appreciate you returning my call. I like to inform you. They are recorded for quality purposes. I'm calling with doctor S Care Management team. We're offering a care management program which is a phone call from our dedicated nurse where she checks in with you in between office visits. She'll answer questions or concerns. Help manage current health conditions can assist with medications, lab results, community resources. If needed, anything that pertains to your health, you would just be an added resource. It is a billable service to [PHI-Personal], [PHI-Personal] Advantage plans and secondary insurance carriers subject to deductible copay co insurance. So you may receive a statement from the practice for those services. As long as you still have the Geisinger Gold, there would be no copay. Would you prefer if the nurse reached out to you in the morning or afternoon, sharing morning? Ok, perfect. And I'll go ahead and mail out some information for you. I've got your address as [PHI-Geographic] Yes. Excellent. Alright. And we are all set. I appreciate your time today. You have a great afternoon and stay safe.
Patient: Ok. And you said this is no cost though,
Nurse: Correct? No copay. Ok. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye bye bye.
