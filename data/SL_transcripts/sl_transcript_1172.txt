Nurse: Hello, this is [PHI-Personal] Car. [PHI-Personal]. Call the ambulance for me. Ok. What's the matter? Well, he has been in bed all day. I want to get up. He said leave me alone. He pissed all over the floor. No, I need to get him in the hospital. Ok, I, I, uh, I, uh, call the sun and ah, so his pulse ox. So it's what 99 93 laying down here didn't drink all day. [PHI-Geographic] like grand do know he doesn't, he don't look good. Ok, I don't wanna get out of bed.
Patient: Ok. My big, my suggestion to you is for you. You need to call 911. It's gonna be easier for you to get to them because I don't know the situation. You need to call 911 and have them come. Ok. Ok. And I will call you back in a few minutes.
Nurse: Ok. Bye bye bye bye.
