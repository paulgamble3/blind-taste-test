Nurse: This is [PHI-Personal]. Nurse care manager.
Patient: Hi, [PHI-Personal]. Uh, this is [PHI-Personal]. I talked to you the other day about her. Yeah. What'[PHI-Personal] going on? Well, I had a call from doctor office yesterday, uh, that they had gotten lab, uh, reports back and they said she was, uh, she had, must have been dehydrated. She had a low kidney function. I think they said [PHI-Personal]%. And, uh, it looks like she'[PHI-Personal] diabetic now. So I just went down to [PHI-Geographic]. I, I had asked them to call [PHI-Geographic] so they would get the message right, rather than me relay the message. But they did, they did call them but they didn't say anything. So I asked about, uh, if there was anything that needed done and, uh, the nurse said that they didn't get any orders to have anything done and they called doctor'[PHI-Personal] office called today to set up an appointment for her and they don't have anything until [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: Yeah, I see that in here. Ok.
Patient: So, does she need an order from that office for them to get lab work or? I don't know how to do that. Where does she even get lab work done if she'[PHI-Personal] a gray stone. Do you know that
Nurse: [PHI-Personal] is [PHI-Geographic], a nursing home or is that it'[PHI-Personal] assisted living? Yeah, assisted living. Ok. Um,
Patient: I, she said, um, the girl I talked to the, uh, director wasn't there and the head nurse was off for the weekend and the girl I talked to said she saw [PHI-Personal] did all the lab work but she wasn't sure, but she said she didn't think there were any orders or anything there to have anything done.
Nurse: No, that'[PHI-Personal] not seeing anything in here. Um,
Patient: Um,
Nurse: This ok, so it looks like they had just called you today to get that appointment scheduled. Ok. I'm sorry, I'm trying to catch up because you talked to [PHI-Personal] the other day. Oh, ok. And you're [PHI-Personal]. Yeah, we tag team it though. I'm just trying to get caught up here. So it looks like, let me see. Um, yeah, it looks like her glucose level was elevated. Now, was this a fasting lab? Is my question here because if it, let me see if they drew an A one C now her A one C is 6.8. So that'[PHI-Personal] not too shabby. I'm setting. I'm betting that this last lab draw was not fasting, which was why that sugar was elevated, but she definitely was dehydrated. I can see that.
Patient: Well, they were giving her, uh, insulin shots at Tyrone rehab and she had never had that before. They said her sugar, sugar level was looking very
Nurse: [PHI-Personal]. Ok. Yeah. Her, I mean, her, a one c is indicative of, that'[PHI-Personal], that'[PHI-Personal] one of the labs that we use to diagnose diabetes. And hers is a little on the higher side. But can, but it'[PHI-Personal] where we want it to be if you do have diabetes. So, they've been giving her insulin then, huh? So, I'm not seeing that on her list either. So that must have been new there.
Patient: Yeah, because II, I watched them give her the, on the, the few times I was visiting.
Nurse: Ok. So, did you wanna see if you'd be able to get something sooner or just if there'[PHI-Personal] any other orders?
Patient: I didn't know if you needed an order sent to [PHI-Geographic] to have anything done or?
Nurse: Well, she just got lab work drawn, uh, looks like on the [PHI-Personal]. So she had lab work drawn yesterday. Oh, ok. Yeah. So that'[PHI-Personal] all been taken care of.
Patient: I think they called me yesterday about her lab work and then they called today to set up an appointment.
Nurse: Ok. They probably wanna see because I'm looking because the glucose level did go up. But again, if it'[PHI-Personal] not fasting labs, we do expect that glucose level to be a little higher. Um, and then I'm not seeing any other orders at this point. Um, it looks like they also did a urine culture, which was clear. So that'[PHI-Personal] good. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, it looks like they did a full spectrum of labs just yesterday.
Patient: Ok. Well, that must have been the report, uh, that she called me with then yesterday. I don't know if it would have happened that quickly. But,
Nurse: Hm. Yeah, because it, well, it looks like yesterday they ordered the hemoglobin A one C, but I'm not sure this is where I'm not sure if, if it'[PHI-Personal], uh, gonna be covered by insurance because she just had the hemoglobin A one C drawn on the [PHI-Personal] of this month and usually they'll only check it twice a year because there'[PHI-Personal] not gonna be much of a change between and 20 days. That'[PHI-Personal] a lab that takes about three months to really see a difference.
Patient: Ok. Well, I just didn't know if I needed to follow up or do anything or, uh, I go down and talk to the, the, the head nurse Monday. Yeah. It doesn't
Nurse: Seem like there'[PHI-Personal] anything that needs to be done today. It looks like the big thing is they just wanted to get her in for that appointment, which she'[PHI-Personal] got on the [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Ok. Well, I guess if nothing else I could see when doctor [PHI-Personal] at urgent care and maybe get her over there.
Nurse: Quite possibly. Yeah. Um, I mean, it does, she have anything else going on other than the shingles,
Patient: Not that I know of, but I, I haven't seen her since Saturday. She'[PHI-Personal] in quarantine because it'[PHI-Personal] so far, I know what they tell me when I go, I go in every day to see what'[PHI-Personal] going on but, you know, just relying on what they tell you. It'[PHI-Personal] usually a different nurse every day. So.
Nurse: Right. Um, so I'm, it doesn't seem like there'[PHI-Personal] any new orders or anything right now. Um,
Patient: So you think it'[PHI-Personal] ok to wait until August [PHI-Personal]
Nurse: First at this point? It, it, because it sounds like the nursing home is taking care of the sugar issue too. Um, I think it should be ok because I'm not seeing anything super bad on her labs other than, I mean, her sugar is elevated, but again, they're gi giving her the insulin at the nursing home and then, um, really the biggest thing that I'm seeing here is to just make sure that she'[PHI-Personal] hydrated.
Patient: Ok. Well, I'll get on Monday and check with the nurse that'[PHI-Personal] in charge and make sure that'[PHI-Personal] all happening.
Nurse: Yeah, because what, uh, the only thing I'm seeing here is a difference because she had the labs on [PHI-Personal] and then July [PHI-Personal]. Um, it looks like that sugar level went up a little bit, but it'[PHI-Personal] also gonna be more concentrated if her, um, if she'[PHI-Personal] dehydrated too, which we can see by what'[PHI-Personal] called the B UN level, the bun. Um, and it looks like she even the second time she still could use a little bit more fluid. Ok. But it looks ok. Yeah, but it'[PHI-Personal] even like the kidney function has improved. Um, she just still needs to get a little bit more fluid in
Patient: Her. Ok. Maybe I'll try to get her some water with electrolytes or something in it. Like smart water or, well, any
Nurse: Sort of water we'll do. Um, trying to think of some other good snacks and stuff. Is, is she a big water drinker or not really? Um,
Patient: I would say average she does drink water. She, you know, she always knew she had to do that. But,
Nurse: Ok. Um, so some other, oh, go ahead.
Patient: She was doing, she was doing that thickened liquid for two weeks. So maybe that wasn't enough fluid, you know, help her
Nurse: Swallowing. That could be it. Yeah. Um, so there'[PHI-Personal] some other things that you can do to help increase that water intake that isn't necessarily just water. Um, like maybe, especially like right now in the summer [PHI-Personal] is really good to bring for her grapes berries. That kind of fruit has a lot of water in it. Um, that can really help hydrate her a little bit. Um, I, I know it'[PHI-Personal] a thickened liquids. That is, is she still on thickened or is she ok to regular?
Patient: She, she'[PHI-Personal] on, she'[PHI-Personal] been on regular since Friday or Saturday?
Nurse: Good, good.
Patient: Ok. Yeah, she was on the second for a good a week and a half or
Nurse: Longer. I'm betting that probably contributed to it because I've tried that thicken before. Just out of curiosity, it'[PHI-Personal] not good. Um It'[PHI-Personal], it'[PHI-Personal] really not. Um, so even things like, uh, I mean, we usually recommend about [PHI-Personal] to 50 ounces of fluid a day or like 4 to 68 ounce cups and water. Truly is the best because her electrolytes really aren't looking too bad. There'[PHI-Personal] no extra sugar or calories or anything in water. Um, but try to maybe do some of those fruits things like that. [PHI-Personal] is really good to help hydrate her too. Um because Jello is mostly just also thickened water too. Yeah, so Jello is very, very good fruits, things like that.
Patient: Yeah. Well, she likes [PHI-Personal] too. So
Nurse: There you go. Yep. Bring up the na Jello. Yeah. Yeah, that would be good to help get some more fluid into her and then um, they'll see her at her next appointment in August. Ok. All right. Appreciate your help. Absolutely. Do you have any other thoughts? Questions concerns?
Patient: No. No, I don't think so. I'll, I'll see what'[PHI-Personal] going on Monday and take it from there.
Nurse: All right. Well, if you need anything else, don't hesitate to give us a call. Ok, I
Patient: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Nurse: You're welcome. Take care. Uh huh bye bye bye bye.
