Nurse: Care management. This is Natalie. Uh Yes, hi. This is Colleen calling you back. Hi, how are you, Colleen? Good. How are you? Good. Just one moment and I'll pull your chart up here. Oh, great. Yeah. So like I mentioned in the voice mail, uh calling on behalf of Family practice with Ryan Horna. Um and we are on a recorded line for quality, but basically Ryan is offering a care management and behavioral health program. It's just a phone call from a dedicated nurse where she would check in with you between your visits. She could answer questions or concerns, assist with medications, lab results, prescription costs, really anything pertaining to your health. She would be an added resource and would of course keep Ryan updated with current conditions or any changes, care management and behavioral health are billable services to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans and secondary insurances. So may be subject to coinsurance, deductibles and copays. I do see you'd qualify with your community blue insurance and you would have a $0 copay. Now, the nurse, she could reach out on a monthly basis or every 2 to 3 months. That would be up to you would you have a preference if she called in the mornings or the afternoons um afternoon? Ok. Sure. And let me just confirm your address here. I'll send out some information including her phone number for you. 6003 Bluestone Ave in Harrisburg. Yeah. Ok. Alright. Well, I'll send that out for you Colleen and then she'll give a call in the next week or two. Ok. Ok. Ok, thanks so much. You have a good one. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye bye bye bye.
