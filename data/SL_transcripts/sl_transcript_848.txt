Nurse: I'm gonna look right now. I didn't hear anything at lunch, but let me, is it getting worse?
Patient: The pain is there? It's like it's sitting right in my groin, in the joint area.
Nurse: So the nurse forwarded it to, um, the doctor. So we're just waiting on his response. So maybe by the end of the day he'll probably get to it.

Patient: Ok, thank you, honey.
Nurse: You're welcome. I hope
Patient: You bit better. I hope so. I put the heating pad on it to hope that it would help, but it's not so, uh, too deep inside, I guess. Must be.
Nurse: All right. Well, I'll talk to you either in the morning. If I hear anything in the next half hour, then I'll give you a call but most likely in the morning. Ok.
Patient: Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright, thanks. Bye.
