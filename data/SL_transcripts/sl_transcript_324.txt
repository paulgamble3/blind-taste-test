Nurse: [PHI-Geographic]. This is [PHI-Personal]

Patient: Uh Yeah, it's about 10, 10 or 12. And what, what I do is, uh, at a sitting, I usually take about three readings. So, do you want all three readings for each setting or do you just want the first one for each one? Um,
Nurse: Let's just do the first one for each one. Let me let me get my pen and paper ready here one second

Nurse: Bit lower.
Patient: Um, yeah, but that's ok.
Nurse: Well, uh, or if you, ok, so let's do it this way. If you're saying that, like you sit down and like, you wait about five minutes and then you're taking it, let's do that last reading because then the first reading may be too high if you've not like, you know, because when you take your BP, you want to sit and like, you know, not have your legs crossed and like sitting still for a few minutes before you take it.
Patient: Ok, so let's do the last reading. Yeah. Ok. Um, I'm gonna start with, ok, let me start with, um, [PHI-Personal]. Ok. And it was 4 30 in the afternoon and the last one was [PHI-Account]. Ok.
