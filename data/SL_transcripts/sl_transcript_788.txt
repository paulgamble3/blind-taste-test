Nurse: [PHI-Personal] Medical Group. This is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hi, [PHI-Personal]. It's [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: [PHI-Personal]. I'm well, how are you?
Patient: I'm ok. I called to tell you that I got the Ozempic number. 0.5. Um,
Nurse: Hold on, let me bring up your chart here. You got the 1.5
Patient: The 0.5.
Nurse: Ok. Is it the three ML or the, um, bye. Yep. Ok. So, yeah, it's because he changed the order. He just signed it in. Good, good, good. Ok. Yeah. So, uh, what it was is, um, they gave you more quantity. It's the same dosage but there's more of the Ozempic in the pen. Yeah, the one that he had ordered the last time was 1.5. That was the quantity and now you have a three. Ok. So that's the only change is how much is in the pen. But the, uh, the pharmacy said that they weren't, they weren't getting the, um, the other one that you were getting, they're not getting that in supply. So I had them change it to the three ML. Ok. So, uh, now the pharmacy says with this medication you should, with, with this dosage of it you should be able to get this on a regular basis without an issue. Oh, ok. So that was the hope.
Patient: That's the
