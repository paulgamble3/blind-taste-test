Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you?
Patient: Yes. Hi. This is Art [PHI-Personal]. I got a message from you on, uh, I couldn't understand part of it. It was garbled.
Nurse: Ok. Hold on just a minute. Let me pull up your chart, right? Just to let you know the call is being recorded for quality purposes. But the reason I reached out to you is because doctor um [PHI-Personal] wanted me to reach out to you and go over the care management program with you. And what that is is where a nurse would give you a call and check in on you. Make sure everything's going well, see if you have any questions or concerns between your office visits. She can also assist with anything like medications, refills, appointments, labs results, anything that pertains to your health and she reports back to the doctor that on your well being. It is a billable service to Medicare, Medicare Advantage and secondary insurance carriers. So it is subject to deductibles, copays, coinsurance and you could receive a statement from the practice. So he was wondering when a good uh, time is for the nurse to reach out to you morning or afternoon.
Patient: Uh, uh, you know what, I, I am not home on any given schedule. Uh, and, and I don't, I don't, actually, I don't feel I need somebody calling and checking on me and stuff. So, I mean,
Nurse: Is it ok if I send you a note or a letter in the mail so that the doctor knows I did reach out to you and, oh, sure. If you ever change your mind, you can give us a call. Yep. Ok. And your address is still the 501, main street, apartment one.
Patient: Uh my mailing address is po [PHI-Personal]
Nurse: Po box 53. All right, I'll get this out and I'll let the doctor know and if you change your mind, just give us a call. Ok. All right. All right. Thank you. Yep. Mm bye bye bye.
