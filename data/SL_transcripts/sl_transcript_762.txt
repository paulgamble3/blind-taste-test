Nurse: Hi, [PHI-Personal]. Hey, [PHI-Personal], how are you? I'm good. How are you doing?
Patient: I'm doing well too. I just had a question for you. Yeah. Excuse me? So that we're on the same page. I got your letter about saying, um, you summarize the goals we set. Yes. Can you, will you go over the, go with me? So we're on the same page. Yeah. Yeah.
Nurse: Yeah. Let me pull, let me pull the letter up real quick. Ok. So all I pull those goals, [PHI-Personal] from, um, your chart. So these are the things that you have left for the year. Um, so you have your annual wellness visit and let me see when that, I don't like to put dates on those like we have, um, well, let's see. Well, I'll tell you I didn't put a date on that one is because it's unknown because you just started, um, with Doctor [PHI-Personal]. Um, I
Patient: Had, I had a wellness visit so I don't feel like I need that.
Nurse: Yeah, then you won't need that if you've already had one this year because, um, [PHI-Personal] will only pay for it once a year. So they do it in that.
Patient: I'm thinking I may have had it in December, but just be told, I don't feel like I need one because I've been having so many doctor appointments that, um, I feel like, you know, they're on top of things.
Nurse: Absolutely. And so then that's gonna knock out like your fall risk assessment, depression screening that's done at every annual wellness visit. So you can mark those two off. Um, and then lab work is usually done at your annual wellness visit as well. Ok. Ok. And then your flu vaccine. Do you get a flu vaccine every year? [PHI-Personal]? I do. Ok, beautiful. So let me look at this. I wanna see. Ok, I go,
Patient: I go by, I go by [PHI-Personal]
Nurse: [PHI-Personal]. [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] and I knew that [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] and when I called you earlier, I think I even left that on your voice mail, didn't I?
Patient: Uh I don't remember.
Nurse: Yeah, I think I did. Um Let me put this right here though. I wanna put this in your chart so that I wanna put [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] right there. There we go. I got it right there, [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal]. Ok. You're welcome. All right, [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal]. So then flu vaccine, I put that on there. So usually you probably get that [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] like around [PHI-Personal], correct.
Patient: That is correct.
Nurse: Ok. So, and then um primary care provider, we always put that on there because you're always gonna see your primary care provider at some point within the year. Ok. Then cardiologist, um, I put the [PHI-Personal], 18, 23 and I do remember this even though I talked to 100 patients. Um, he wanted to see you. Your cardiologist wanted to see you in six months. That's right. Yep. And then your ent, do you see Ent because I did see that in your chart, it looked like you did see ENT,
Patient: This will be my first visit and that's [PHI-Personal]. I will be seeing my for the first time, an ent person
Nurse: Beautiful. So that's why I put that on there. So then with the annual wellness visit fall risk assessment, depression screening, if you wanna mark those off, you know, you can mark those off. And then the other ones um I put in the put on there just for friendly reminders for you.
Patient: Ok? And then, um I will be, let me see. Oh, I got a call the other day. I, I had a, I have some nodules on my thyroid and they did a sonogram in [PHI-Personal]. And then I got a call from the office. Doctor [PHI-Personal] office two days ago saying that uh she wants to have a follow up on that which I knew she was going to in like six or seven months. So they, I'm waiting to hear from to schedule that appointment.
Nurse: Ok? And I see that in here. Let me look at something because we put in the order they put in the order yesterday at [PHI-Personal] 33. So, um let me look at something, the order
Patient: For to call you mean?
Nurse: Well, it says patient's choice. Let me look, I'm looking [PHI-Personal], I'm just gonna send a message, I'm gonna send a message. Let me look at something. I'm gonna send a message over to [PHI-Personal] and let [PHI-Personal] know that. Did you tell [PHI-Personal]? You wanted it to go to [PHI-Personal]?
Patient: Um, I don't know which girl I spoke to but, uh, she, I did speak whoever I spoke to said, yes, I wanna go to and that's where I had my last one. And that's a convenient location for me. And she said, ok, I will let, and I told her that I'm busy next week, but the following week I could go and she said, well, I'll have them call you with the date
Nurse: You spoke to is who you spoke to. I just looked at that.
Patient: That's right. That
Nurse: Is right. Yeah, you spoke to. Um, so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna send a message to [PHI-Personal]. Let [PHI-Personal] know that you wanna go to [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Yeah. Ok. Um, because, yeah, that's why I went in [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: Ok. Yeah, I'll send, uh, I'll send a message to [PHI-Personal]. Um, and then if, um, if we need to do and if, if I need to do anything on my end, [PHI-Personal] James, then I will give you a call and let you know. No worries. We'll get it all handled, we'll get it all
Patient: Handled. Yeah. And I, and you know, and I'm not in a rush short. I mean, I do wanna have it done because I wanna make sure these nodules aren't growing or what have you. But absolutely, I just, uh, you know, as I say, she, I didn't, I didn't have, I didn't hear back. Oh, I'll just ask about it.
Nurse: Ok, perfect. Yeah, and I'll, I will keep an eye on that [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] and make sure that everything gets handled with that. Um, over the next few days sometimes. I mean, it does take a few days to get that scheduled and everything, but I'll make sure I'll follow up on that at the beginning of next week. I'm writing it on my calendar right now. Um, and I will follow up with you on it too as well and let you know. Ok.
Patient: Um, has it this chronic care, um, service, is that something that's just for seniors?
Nurse: Um, you have to have, um, two chronic conditions. So, you know, um, I have some patients that, um, are not seniors, um, but you have to have two chronic conditions, meaning, you know, hypertension, you know, CKD, chronic, um, you know, heart failure, diabetes, et cetera. Does that make sense?
Patient: Yes, because I was telling my sister who's [PHI-Personal] years younger than I am and she goes to doctor [PHI-Personal] Lucy Lynch and uh, she said, oh, my gosh. I love that service because I told her how I just am so thrilled to have it because, um, it, it, it, I think it's just a wonderful service. And anyway, she, I said, I don't know if it's because she's, she would only be [PHI-Personal]. So I didn't know if it was [PHI-Personal] and older or whatever. But I'll tell her that she can expect a word about it because she does have some chronic conditions.
Nurse: Yeah. Tell her, tell her to ask Doctor [PHI-Personal] because Doctor [PHI-Personal], yeah, tell her to ask Doctor [PHI-Personal] about it.
Patient: Yeah. Yeah, I will because she, she, uh, she does have some chronic pain and I think she would really like this service and I think it, it's a real comforting thing to have, uh, someone that you can call.
Nurse: Yeah. Absolutely. And doctor Doctor [PHI-Personal] knows me very well. So, um, you know, tell her to ask Doctor [PHI-Personal] and if she is, you know, a candidate for her, um, if it, you know, if she is a candidate for it, um, tell Doctor [PHI-Personal] to just shoot me a message and Doctor [PHI-Personal] will do it and we'll get her, we'll get her enrolled if we can.
Patient: Good, good, good, good. Well, that's all I wanted to. I just wanted to make sure we were on the, I was on the same page as what your goals were for me. And
Nurse: Yes, absolutely. Yep. Absolutely. Absolutely. My friend and you call me any time you have any questions? Ok,
Patient: I sure will. And you have a wonderful weekend.
Nurse: You too, [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal], stay, stay cool. Ok, I'm gonna try. Alright, [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Personal] have a great weekend. Thanks
Patient: So much. Bye bye bye.
