Nurse: Hi, this is [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Hey, this is [PHI-Personal] o'neill. Um, I just missed your call, so I'm calling you back. Hi,
Nurse: Bar, I just wanted to check in with you and [PHI-Personal] and see how things were going.
Patient: Um, let's see, he still has one more appointment to get a cancer taken off the year. That's on the [PHI-Personal] of this month and they have canceled his appointment with the cardiologist and they were gonna make it for the end of [PHI-Personal], but we'll just see one when we go home that, um, I am going to have hip surgery.
Nurse: Ohh, my goodness. I think, uh, they
Patient: Already approved it. They approved it before we left and I don't know whether I probably need to see [PHI-Personal] when we get there sometime in [PHI-Personal]. Can you make the appointments or I'll call them and make them? I
Nurse: Can, um, if you give me, um, what days work better and times of day I can have the office make them for you.
Patient: Ok. Times a day are not a problem. We should be home sometime, I would think by the second week in [PHI-Personal]. So maybe around the third week in [PHI-Personal] we can do that. Ok, let me just check my list and make sure I don't have another appointment any day. And, uh, that would help. No, I have a dentist appointment on [PHI-Personal] and then something with, but that's on the [PHI-Personal] of May, but that's fine. Ok. So the end of [PHI-Personal] with time, that's good. And then you can just send me a text that works fine. Ok, I will
Nurse: Let them know. Excuse me. And let's see. Come on computer. We're running a little slow this morning. That's ok. Um,
Patient: The surge room will be in Lake because I see a doctor from, um, Lake Placid. Right? Ok. Oly, the [PHI-Geographic] over there. So. Oh,
Nurse: How's the [PHI-Personal] down there? Is it still really nice?
Patient: It has been a weird winter. It gets hot. It'll be 80 today, but it's been in the thirties and [PHI-Personal] and it was like 32 again yesterday morning. So I just up and down there's no big trees like we have. So when the sun goes down it gets cold. Hm. It's ok. We're not shoveling anything. So, if that's
Nurse: True. Very true. Yeah. Hm. Computer keeps freezing. Let's see any issues
Patient: That you should have a on today because I think it's supposed to get up in the [PHI-Personal] where you are today, right. Yes. Yeah. Ok. So the maple syrup should be running. Oh, I hope
Nurse: So. I can't wait after the weekend. We've had, we could really use some of this warmer
Patient: [PHI-Personal]. How much snow did you get
Nurse: Where I am? We got about 13 inches. Even though they called for seven.
Patient: Where are you?
Nurse: I'm just [PHI-Geographic] of [PHI-Geographic].
Patient: Oh, ok. Well, you're not anywhere near, but now you really are working from home. Yeah. Ok. Do you see to?
Nurse: No, I don't.
Patient: Ok. So you're just off site, period. Yes.
Nurse: Yep. And no issues with blood pressures. Everything's running normal there. Right?
Patient: He still has, um, notices on his watch that he goes into AFIB. No, they have changed his medicine a couple of times and we will see his cardiologist when we get home. I will call actually, I'll call today and make an appointment with doctor. That's who he sees, but he needs to see to too. So. Right.
Nurse: Ok. All right. So I'll get these messages sent over to the office, um, for appointments for the third week of [PHI-Personal]. Um, and I will make sure they reach out either by text message or some way. Um, ok. So you guys are notified and I will reach out again sometime in [PHI-Personal]. We'll see how things are going. Ok.
Patient: Ok. Thank you so much [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: You're welcome. Have a wonderful day.
Patient: Ok, thank you. Bye bye. Yeah.
