Nurse: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Care Management. My name is [PHI-Personal]. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, [PHI-Personal]. My name is [PHI-Personal]. I received a call from you this morning and you were telling me that there's a program that they have that I could probably qualify for.
Nurse: Yes. Thank you for returning my call. I do wanna inform you they are recorded for quality purposes. Uh Doctor [PHI-Personal] is providing a care management program which is a phone call from our dedicated nurse where she checks in with you in between your office visits. She'll answer questions or concerns. She'll help manage current health conditions can assist you with medications, lab results. Anything that pertains to your health, she would be an added resource. Now, the calls are documented. Doctor is updated with your well being on a monthly basis. It is a billable service to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans and secondary insurance carriers. They would be subject to deductible co pay co insurance. So you may receive a statement from the practice for those services. Now, with your insurance, I'm showing there would be no co pay. Now the nurse can contact you on a monthly basis or every couple of months. That's completely up to you. Would you prefer if she reached out in the morning or afternoon?
Patient: Oh, I don't need that service right now. I'm pretty healthy. I, um, come in to, I do all the, the appointments doctor, uh, gave me and I come in, uh, twice a year and I'm ok.
Nurse: Ok. Not a problem. [PHI-Personal]. What I'll do is mail out the nurses information and if you need us on the line, feel free to reach out then.
Patient: Thank you so much. I appreciate you letting me know about it too. Thank you.
Nurse: Not a problem. Thank you for calling back. Have a great day.
Patient: You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
