Nurse: I guess your car wanted to hang up on me. I guess
Patient: It rude this morning.
Nurse: Yeah, it's all right. I'm, I was looking while I was, you said about the, uh, four tablets. I can't see any reason. It just says don't over, go o, like, go over four tablets in a day.
Patient: Ok. I mean, you know how they just put stuff and I only read a couple of things and so I said it's working so I, I don't need to go to four gonna cause any problems. So,
Nurse: Yeah, I don't know. Maybe just some, some people are sensitive to certain medications or changes or maybe they fell after a certain time. It wasn't working. But, yeah, everything I'm reading.
Patient: Yeah, I, I ate last night, I was craving them and my wife had them sitting there so I had to eat them. So, what did you have? Pretty me
Nurse: Balls. Oh, my gosh.
Patient: Well, you know, I sell Easter eggs, like, at the feed store. Do you have 1500 Easter eggs in that store at all
Nurse: Times? Don't tell me that.
Patient: Yeah. So that church is, and I haven't, I have stayed away from them. I, you know what I mean? I've been able to do it.
Nurse: Well, that's good because I wouldn't because peanut butter is my weakness. It is, it is good. I will literally take a spoon and dip it in the peanut butter jar. Yeah. Yeah. That's been done before. Well, I'm not gonna Google where your feed store is because, so, because then I may be need to be prescribed the Contrave, go on.
Patient: Well, I, I'm gonna start taking the two and two and just see. Uh, yeah.
Nurse: Yeah. And then, yeah, like, like I said, like the increased heart rate or BP or any odd, odd symptoms. Of course, with the increase in one day, you may have it for one day, but if it continues after the four, just go back to the three if that's working so well. All right. Well, I'll follow up with you next month but it's always give me a call if you need anything. Uh, yeah, you have a good day too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
