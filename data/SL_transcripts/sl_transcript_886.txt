Uh huh. Um so the reason why she missed her appointment was because she had the other appointment with the specialist to remove that adapter. So when she told them that she had to reschedule, they rescheduled her all the way out to [PHI-Personal]. Oh no,
Nurse: That was, that was my concern too. Yeah, so I was just checking with you to know,
Patient: See what was going on before that. Yeah, she need an appointment before that and especially because the doctor told me yesterday that um they're gonna need his approval for the surgery, I guess for the referral. Ok. Her primary care physician. So,
Nurse: So she kinda needs like a medical clearance appointment.
Patient: Yeah. And I guess she can, uh, maybe doctor I can bring it up about her depression.
Nurse: Ok. Ok. And then when are they planning to?
Patient: So they're shooting for it may either be, uh, [PHI-Personal], she said, or [PHI-Personal]. It's a two part surgery. So they, they install one part, the 14th and then a week exactly to the date the [PHI-Personal] would be the second part.
