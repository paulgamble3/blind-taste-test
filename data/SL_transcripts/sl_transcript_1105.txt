Nurse: Thank you. I do appreciate that [PHI-Personal]. I wanna inform you calls are recorded for quality purposes. I'm with family practice on behalf of care management. We're providing our new program. It's a call from our nurse where they, she, she checks in with you in between office visits. She'd answer any questions or concerns. She'll help manage your chronic conditions. She can assist with medications, lab results, community resources. Anything that pertains to your health, the nurse would be a good resource for. Now, the calls are documented. They are treated as a billable service to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans and secondary insurance carriers would be subject to deductible copay, coinsurance. So you may receive a statement from the practice for those services if interested [PHI-Personal], would you prefer the nurse reached out to you in the morning or afternoon?
Patient: Uh um I don't really think that I need this service right now. Um because um I'm not really having a, an issue that I need to monitor right at the moment. Um So I mean, why would the nurse be calling me?
