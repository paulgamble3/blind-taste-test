Well, I don't know if he wants to, like, send me to, I'm not gonna be on pain management. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, we're gonna have to actually fix the knee. I won't put something pot so I can take pills. That's not gonna happen.
Nurse: [PHI-Account]. Ok. Well,
Patient: You know, it's legal here where I am.
Nurse: Yeah. It's just honestly, I, I've had so many patients have success with it that I'm like, well, why would you stop it? You know.
Patient: Mm. I have mental problems so it helps me a lot and even the psychiatrist, even my psychiatrist says, well, I know it helps with stress. Yeah, he doesn't say anything but doctor cannot put me on pain management when I'm gonna pee dirty.
Nurse: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, no. Get away. All right. Let me just put this in here. So no changes pain 10 being the worst. Zero being, no, not being at all. Where's your pain at it? On a nice,
