Nurse: Yes, ma'am. Ok. So the reason for my call is Doctor [PHI-Personal] is perform, is providing a care management program. Um Before I begin, I, I will let you know we are on a recorded line for quality purposes. Um So the program that he's providing is where a dedicated nurse will call you in between your doctor visits. Should provide you with any assistance on your current health conditions, um medications, lab results and community resources. And this program helps doctor to stay up to date on your well being in between those office visits and to make sure that you're just staying safe and healthy. And the program is a billable service to Medicaid uh to Medicare, Medicare advantage and secondary insurances. It's considered an office visit. So it may be subject to co insurance deductibles and copays. So you may get a statement from the practice for the service and the nurse can call you once a month, every two months, every three months or every six months. Would you prefer morning or afternoon calls?
