Patient: Well so far. Yes.
Nurse: Mhm. Good. Um, any issues or concerns with your medications?
Patient: No, not right now. I've been taking the, I don't know how to say the name anyway. Huh? Early in the morning because you got to take it with water half an hour before you eat. And so far I don't seem to have any, you know, issues with it. Ok,
Nurse: Perfect. Scroll through here. You're still taking the Metformin with that. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes.
Nurse: Um, no issues with the, the two together
Patient: So far. I haven't seen anything. No.
Nurse: Um, the Metformin, you know, is notorious for g I upset. So, just be mindful of that. But, um, if that's still working for you then, uh, we'll just keep monitoring it. Um, now you don't check your blood sugars. Right. Yes,
Patient: I do. Twice a day, twice a day.
Nurse: Ok. Um, and how have those numbers been for you?

Had two high ones over the weekend at, after dinner. I don't know why. But anyway, that other than that they've been, you know, pretty low. Ok.
Nurse: Um, you're not symptomatic with that at all. Right.
Patient: No. Huu ok.
Nurse: Good. And then any issues with your BP recently,
Patient: Not that I know of. I mean, I, you know, usually, I mean, if it acts up, I know because I get this tremendous headache and stuff. So I guess it's ok.
