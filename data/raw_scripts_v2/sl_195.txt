Nurse: Uh, the appointment was pe T oh, ok. MRI shoulder in the shoulder. Ok. Mhm. Gonna call gum. Mhm. And systematic. Mhm. Ok. This is my history should not, right?
Patient: Ok. Mhm. Ok. Uh
Nurse: I yet.
Patient: Ok. Uh
Nurse: Discharge to. Oh. Mhm. The time I will be the love. Mm. Go
Patient: What volume?
Nurse: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hurt me. Yeah. Mhm. Then you know, but enough uh, pain management. Uh. Mhm. Back if, if, if, what is it you have shoulder appointment like the yes uh, appointment you ask him. He, they, they did much more X rays not just like a not supposed to be that it's not dislocated so it's probably just pushing it out on.
Patient: Bye that the one,
Nurse: Said that there no injections, nothing he sent me for MRI S to see if there is, uh, he said most likely there's also tears around of the connective shield.
Patient: Mhm.
Nurse: But I, I need it with contrast, uh, their injector is broken. They're supposed to, they were supposed to get the piece yesterday, then yesterday they called me and they said the still didn't get the piece and they made it for 19, but they made it for open MRI. Mhm. And yesterday they called and they said that it's not good. I, I cannot have Open MRI because it's not gonna show much. I need to in depth. So this gives a, the four [PHI-Account] I think. And on [PHI-Personal], I'm seeing, uh, the surgeon in the morning before doctor [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Well, [PHI-Account] least you'll get an A. Mhm. Yeah.
Nurse: Yeah. Uh, but like I said, he said, there is no cream, nothing. He asked me if I needed any more medication, but I understand I don't need anymore. I'm taking so much. Uh, I just got away the, the story got away from me, uh, the, from, from, uh, he only [PHI-Personal]. So the, the call that so, yeah, I'm just limiting myself for one, Ibuprofen before I go to bed.
Patient: Ok. Um, no. [PHI-Personal] when she dies. Uh, it a, um, uh, ok. So,
Nurse: Uh, hm. No, no. Yes.
Patient: Uh, she Ibuprofen [PHI-Account] the NSA [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: I just, I don't wanna start with new medications and I don't know, I'm just so tired of all those medications to tell you honestly. Like I said, I'm limiting myself to one Ibuprofen a day. Uh, I'm not doing it [PHI-Account] night time. It, the most, a lot of pain [PHI-Account] night time. It literally comes out of the joint when I'm sleeping, especially if I'm sleeping on the deck, it pushes it out. Bye, doctor.
Patient: Keep watching the effect of us. Uh, weight
Nurse: Gain. Yeah. Uh, yes. If I have to go through something already, [PHI-Account] least I'm looking for like a positive, you know, something positive, something positive with the skin. What I lost weight. Mhm.
Patient: [PHI-Personal]. Um,
Nurse: How many times do you see that the cancer comes back four times in the same spot when you do not have a breast anymore?
Patient: Ok. You're, you're right. You're right.
Nurse: I'm the lucky one. Yep. And plus, like I said, I don't wanna, I just don't wanna start any new medication. I don't want any pain medications. I'm afraid that I will never get. And, yeah, got it. My daughter is she making popcorn. She's making a lot of noise. I'm talking to the nurse. Oh, sorry. Ok. Yeah,
Patient: That's ok. Um, your gabapentin. I
Nurse: Won't be able to sleep [PHI-Account] night time. I only take it. Uh, I take three pills. I take [PHI-Account] mg. Uh, before I go to bed I take gabapentin. I take, uh, and I take, uh, Ibuprofen. Not all [PHI-Account] once. I never, I never, ever, ever, I have phobia. I never miss any medication. I always give [PHI-Account] least half an hour. It's in my mind. Uh, I think half an hour is enough to give, uh, I don't take any medication together.
Patient: Got you. So, you just use it mostly for the evening and night dose. You don't actually use it during the day [PHI-Account] all. No. And that
Nurse: Said yes. But, uh, uh, and Ibuprofen only for night Endocet. I take, uh, four times a day.
Patient: Ok.
Nurse: Otherwise I'll be just, uh, [PHI-Personal] and morning and [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Ok. All right. Well, the other thing that I, I will mention about [PHI-Personal], the, the new medication that they wanted you to switch to one of the, I, it's not just the pain medication, it's mostly anti-inflammatory. And that's what? Yes, I, I
Nurse: Know.
Patient: Well, Ibuprofen works usually for like, up to six hours, up to eight hours. [PHI-Personal] tends to build up in the system. That's why it's usually prescribed, like once a day or twice a day. It doesn't give you a significant effect right away. But instead it gives you more of a chronic pain management. I
Nurse: Understand. But so, well, listen, hopefully when they take care of that, uh, my shoulder, I will have to take it. So it's ok. I'll, I'll just take for now with Ibuprofen, then I'll stop ibuprofen altogether.
Patient: Ok. Like I said, I'm just giving you all the information. I know you can make your,
Nurse: I'm using logic.
Patient: How's your, uh, blood sugars, by the way? Not
Nurse: So bad. Not so bad, I think. Well, [PHI-Account]. But is, you know, not too bad.
Patient: Ok. Yeah, that's, I think that's actually better than the last time we talked. Yeah, because I think, because you, I think you told me it was [PHI-Account] 80 last time. Oh, my.
Nurse: Yes. No, no, it's been, it's been.
Patient: That's good. How has your BP been?
Nurse: Uh, I, to tell you honestly I don't check it every day but when, whenever I have and I see a lot of doctors it's good. It's 1 [PHI-Personal], over, like, 70 like below 1 20.
Patient: Ok. Yeah, I understand that. You go so often to the doctors you'll that makes sense to just
Nurse: Get the full time job for me. It's a full time job.
Patient: Yeah it makes sense to just check her BP there.
Nurse: II I know uh I know you you called me and you left me a voicemail. Remember I said I didn't remember when was um when I had an appointment to my endocrinologist and you and of course I I erased that uh the voice mail and I never wrote down the appointment so now I don't remember when the appointment I have.
Patient: Oh no I have it written down somewhere. It is uh [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Account] [PHI-Personal] [PHI-Account] [PHI-Personal]
Nurse: [PHI-Account]. Ok, I'm gonna write it down. Not right now [PHI-Account] what time I'm
Patient: Sorry. [PHI-Account]
Nurse: [PHI-Personal]. Hm. It was I see in the morning I made it so late [PHI-Personal] I'm gonna write it down. Ok. Ok.
Patient: Alright well I don't have any other questions for you right now. Do you have anything for me?
Nurse: No, everything is, you know, we discussed everything. Ok. And I said I'm seeing doctor [PHI-Account] [PHI-Personal]. Yeah, soon enough.
Patient: Yes. Well, good luck um, with your MRI and pet scan, if you need anything, let me know. Ok,
