Patient: Yeah, that's ok.
Nurse: Ok. Give me one second. My dear.
Patient: He always gets nervous when somebody calls him like this. The doctor calls him. It was like, why are they calling me
Nurse: For? And so do I, but no, there's nothing, there's nothing wrong. Nothing wrong. Ok. Give me one second here.
Patient: Nothing's the matter with you. They're just setting up your care team. Yes. So what's the matter with me now?
Nurse: No, nothing is, nothing is wrong. He's good. Uh, why is my computer being slow? Okey Dokie. So, just to run through how the program works, um, he'll be assigned a nurse which is me. My name is [PHI-Personal] and my job is just to, um, work with him towards his health goals and then follow up with doctor [PHI-Personal] in terms of his progress on a monthly basis. Ok. Um I can also help out with things like answering medical questions and concerns and refills and um I just went blank scheduling and everything else in between that he may need good
Patient: Because one of them is they only give him one box of the BD ultra fine needles a month which is only [PHI-Account] and he really needs two boxes because he takes um sometimes [PHI-Personal] shots a day and that would be [PHI-Account] and fif well, three times [PHI-Personal]. Yes, is [PHI-Account] and 50 needles and he's only getting [PHI-Account].
Nurse: Oh ok. So he needs two,
Patient: They need to change it right? He need to change it to 200 a month.
Nurse: Ok, so I can, I can get doctor to work on that. Um Let me see here. So before I do all of that, I do want to confirm a couple of things. Uh you said your name is? Ok, perfect. Thank you.

Patient: Yeah. So you don't have to worry about 10 bottles. They just do it automatically
Nurse: For us. That's convenient. I love it. Yeah,
Patient: I love it. That's the only reason why we stay with them is because they do it that way. Walgreens and stuff don't do it. They're the only ones that I know that will do it the way, you know, that we need it and if we need a medicine right away they have it right there and everything. They're one of the best. We've had them for like, I don't know, 15 years. So, yeah. And then when we moved to [PHI-Geographic] City from [PHI-Geographic], we just said, you know, we're not gonna change because I don't wanna have the thing of doing all these different things here and there and everywhere they do it for me.
