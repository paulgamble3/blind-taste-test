Nurse: All right. And what's the medicine?
Patient: Uh, I'm gonna spell it because I'm not pronounce it. Right. Uh, I cannot read the second letter. Uh, oh, it looks like it's D Delta, India, Lima Dil. And then it's Tiaze MC [PHI-Personal] D Dog. And it looks like after those first three letters, there's either a dot Or space before the ti A zem CD. Right.
Nurse: I've got that medicine. Is it Cardizem? The dim 1 20?
Patient: No, it's not cardio. I picked that one up yesterday. I think it was. No, it's, um, it says 1 20 mg by mouth one time each day. And the I, I'm not sure what PB R means, but I assume that's the physician and it has Donald [PHI-Personal], but I don't know who was prescribing what I was in the hospital, maybe three or four weeks and then a rehab center for about three weeks. So somebody within that seven week period, uh, put me on this medication and I understand that it's, it's something that's significant for me.
Nurse: All right, [PHI-Personal], I believe that I know what might be going on. So, this medicine, the one that you have in your hand, that pill bottle it is over because there's a new prescription that Doctor [PHI-Personal] sent. But Doctor [PHI-Personal] sent it to CV S Caremark. Do you want this sent to a CV S locally instead of CV S Caremark?
Patient: Well, I, I guess if that could be done, I'm, I, I'm seldom like this with, without a particular medication, so I, I want to get it the fastest way. Uh,
Nurse: All right. So, which CV S would you like it sent to? And we can get that done for you today?
Patient: Oh.
Nurse: Or do you want [PHI-Personal]? [PHI-Personal]?
Patient: You, you know, I just as soon do [PHI-Personal] on this one, because I don't get the advantage, uh, of the, uh, caremark of funding for something this small. So, uh, I'd like to go back to [PHI-Personal] where they, uh, heard me and my disappointment about a half an hour ago.
Nurse: Ok. We can take care of this for you, [PHI-Personal], I'm sorry that happened. But that, that was the issue doctor. Uh, uh Ry sent the prescription, he just sent it to CVS caremark instead of [PHI-Personal]. He sent it on [PHI-Personal].
Patient: Ok. So I got to be more precise too because I'm trying to use the less expensive and, uh, many of these that are 90. I hope this one's for 90. Is it, it can take it anyway. But I'm sorry, it is for 90. Yes, sir. Ok. All the more reason let's go to [PHI-Personal], but I have to be precise and, uh, for my own reason. So the poor girl and the person on your end knows which one to send it to.
Nurse: All right. Yeah, whenever you come in to see Doctor [PHI-Personal], just make sure that you specify which pharmacy you want it to go to.
Patient: Believe me, I shall, I'm gonna be over there tomorrow, but I didn't want to wait until tomorrow to try to get this thing resolved.
Nurse: Sure. Yeah, I'm happy to help with this today and then, and, and your
Patient: Name, ma'am and thank you so much. It's [PHI-Personal]. Oh, it is [PHI-Personal]. Well, you were the lady that was nice enough to give me this phone number and I've used it several times. Oh,
Nurse: Good. That's good to hear. And I'm happy to help.
Patient: Ok, so I'll give him a couple of hours to get around to doing what they're gonna do and I'll go back up to [PHI-Personal] locally. Sure.
Nurse: Mhm. I will get this sent to doctor Bu to get his signature and then it'll go to [PHI-Personal]. Ok.
Patient: Thank you very, very much. I appreciate this.
Nurse: You're welcome, [PHI-Personal]. If you need anything else, just give us a call. I got
Patient: Your number.
Nurse: All right, you have a good day.
Patient: Thank you. Bye bye bye.
