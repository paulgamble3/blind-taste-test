Nurse: Haven't, I'm just running a little behind. Everybody seems to be sick that end of last month and beginning of this month. So, I've been running a little behind on my healthy patient calls.
Patient: Huh? Well, I'm still here and still breathing and still everything else. So, that's it. Good. How's your husband doing now? My husband die. No, I did
Nurse: Not. I am so
Patient: Sorry to hear that on Thanksgiving Day. Oh, my
Nurse: Gosh. I am. I am
Patient: So sorry. Yeah, me too. Oh, that's heartbreaking. Life is just not the same. No. Yeah, it's, I just thought I'd call and check in because I hadn't heard from you. So,
Nurse: Yeah. No, you were on my list to call in the next couple of weeks. But, oh, I'm so glad you called.
Patient: Well, I don't really have anything to report. No.
Nurse: But it's still nice to talk to you and
Patient: A careful person. Right.
Nurse: No, you're just stubborn. But I like stubborn.
Patient: Well, I'm more than stubborn but at the moment all I am is hurt. Yeah. No, I'm gonna figure out a way to get that.
Nurse: Yeah. Do you have someone you can talk
Patient: To? You mean a specific person? I have a couple of people I can talk to but I haven't really, you know, well, what to, to say it's over, you know, everything's over. Yeah.
Nurse: But it's, sometimes it's, it's nice to talk about memories that you had shared memories with them or memories you had and reminisce and just share how you're feeling about
Patient: Everything. I don't know how I'm feeling numb. Yeah. No, I can't stay on the phone but I just wanted to call and check in. Make sure I was still considered among the living.
Nurse: Yes, definitely.
Patient: I will. I'll be in touch with you later then. Ok. If
Nurse: You ever need to talk, I'm here.
Patient: Ok. Thank you.
Nurse: You're welcome. Bye bye. Bye bye.
