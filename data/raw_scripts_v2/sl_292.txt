Nurse: At the end of [PHI-Personal]
Patient: She doesn't understand him. And I, and she told me she said, I already told that nurse, I just don't understand and my daughter is the one that does everything for me.
Nurse: Ok. Let me see here. Bear with me here for one moment. Amazing. You know, even the bad I was like, uh, let's see here. How do you know how often, uh, she was having, going to have her nurse contact
Patient: Her? I, I don't know because there's no way she's gonna be able afford that. Right? Because she's on her own. My father had passed away here a co, a couple years ago and she is on her own.
Nurse: Ok, let me get in touch with the nurse here regarding [PHI-Personal] and I'll let her know what's going on. Um,
Patient: She got kind of upset and I talk to mom. I just, I'll call ok. And I will let them know that you, you don't want it.
Nurse: Yeah. So it looks like actually we have her down for just, uh, the nurse to call her just once a year actually. Um, so the, the nurse would only be calling her once a year. Uh, so she may get a statement in from the practice only once a year.
Patient: Uh, she doesn't want it.
