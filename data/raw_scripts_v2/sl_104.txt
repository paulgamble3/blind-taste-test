Nurse: The lowest
Patient: One, lowest [PHI-Geographic] location. Oh, nothing. I didn't get nothing done. We, we, we tried to call over there to get the location. Um, my, my daughter did but I haven't had her from anybody over there yet. Ah, so what should we do? I wanted, I wanted him. Does he, does she know about my shoulder? I was, should I go see, you know, my arm and my right arm and how it, it's just still bothering me a lot.
Nurse: Yeah. So, I, I'm sorry about that. I don't know how that happened.
Patient: Yeah, I get to see him so I need to make an, I need another appointment as soon as I can. I wouldn't, uh, love to because I need to know what to, what can be done about this shoulder.
Nurse: Right. Let me look, let me look here and see if I can find a sooner appointment because you're scheduled for [PHI-Personal].
Patient: [PHI-Personal].
Nurse: But let me see if there's a sooner you are. Yeah.
Patient: Mm. Yeah, that's a long now to me now. Well, I have to all day long. That's dis [PHI-Personal]. I can't do this and that with it. I don't know what to do. I've been doing the, uh, Tylenol and, uh, then I start taking the, the, uh, uh, cod cod Liver or taps gel taps cats.
Nurse: Oh, yeah.
Patient: But II, I mean, it, it stops it for a minute but exercise back when, if I could, I just move my arm just, uh, wee bit ju just too hard. I just, and I, I have to have someone wanted to bathe the left side of my arm on the arm. One of my daughters, I get, uh, my sister, I get where I had to get one of them to bat, wash this side of my arm under the arm because I can't push, I can't take that arm over to, uh, my right arm over that far.
Nurse: Right. So I, I do see, um, so it's not Doctor [PHI-Personal], but one of the nurses, it's a nurse practitioner that helps him. She has an opening, um, tomorrow, tomorrow [PHI-Account] 8 15 [PHI-Account] [PHI-Geographic] Palms.

Patient: He doesn't.
Nurse: No.
Patient: Mm. And I got one for the two in the second.
Nurse: You do. But I'm, I'm wondering if you, if you go in and see her name is [PHI-Personal], um, I think she would be able to help you too and then you could keep the appointment with Doctor [PHI-Personal] in [PHI-Personal]. You know, because it'll, it's like a month away and then see if it's improved by that time.
