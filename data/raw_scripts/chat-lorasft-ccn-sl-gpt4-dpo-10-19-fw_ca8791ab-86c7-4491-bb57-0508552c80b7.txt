Patient: I know where it is, and I will definitely be there on time.
Nurse: Great, it sounds like you're well prepared.Now, have you had any fever, chills, or muscle aches recently?
Patient: No. I haven't.
Nurse: Okay, good.It's important to let us know if you have any signs of infection.Also, remember that you cannot eat or drink anything after midnight the day before the procedure.This is to ensure your stomach is empty during the surgery and reduces the risk of complications.
Patient: I understand.
Nurse: Great, it sounds like you're doing well with your pre-procedure instructions.Now, after the surgery, our anticipated discharge plan is for you to go to a rehab facility.This will allow you to receive physical and occupational therapy support as you recover and work on regaining mobility in your knee.
Patient: Excellent.

Patient: I do understand.
Nurse: Great, it sounds like you're on top of your medication changes.Now, I want to go over some skin prep instructions with you.It's very important that you use a chlorhexidine scrub in the shower the night before and the morning of the procedure.This will help to clean your skin and reduce the risk of infection.Can you do that?
Patient: I definitely can.
Nurse: Great, I'm glad to hear that you're ready to follow the skin prep instructions.Now, do you have any questions about the procedure itself?
Patient: How long would this procedure take?
Nurse: The total knee replacement procedure typically takes about one to two hours.However, you'll be in the hospital for a few hours after the surgery as we monitor your recovery.Does that answer your question?
Patient: Yes. It does. Thank you.
