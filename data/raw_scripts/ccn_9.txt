 Nurse: Jane, I understand you had a right total hip replacement, followed by your stay at the hospital and an acute rehab facility. Now, you are residing with your daughter. Is my understanding correct? 
 Patient: Yeah. 
 Nurse: Wonderful, how has your experience been in this new environment, Jane? 
 Patient: I wish I could go back to my place. I mean, it's okay. There's nothing wrong here except I can't get into the shower and I really would like to take a shower and it's just frustrating. I can't get in there. 
 Nurse: So, it seems you wish to return to your own home, possibly due to higher comfort levels there. Is that an accurate understanding? 
 Patient: I want to be in a position of my daughter here and then it's they're all comfortable here and they have their routines but for me, it's not home. I've been in the rehab facility which is not home either and I just like to get home but I also want to make sure things are going to go okay at home when I get there. I wasn't really that prepared to come back and have this walker thing and I didn't think about the showering situation either. Yeah. 
 Nurse: Understood. So, it appears you want us to devise a strategy to ensure that you can live safely in your home, haven't I got it right? 
 Patient: Yes. And is there a way I can get a shower while I'm here still? 
 Nurse: Certainly, let's address each concern step-by-step. Firstly, have you conveyed your intent to return to your daughter? 
 Patient: Yeah, she knows that. I mean, I think she wants me to go back to her. 
 Nurse: Excellent. My suggestion is to arrange a family meeting, not immediately but when your daughter is available, to devise a plan that includes her. Would you be comfortable talking about this with her included? 
 Patient: Oh, yeah, we can all talk together. 
 Nurse: Splendid. So, you mentioned that you're finding it challenging to take a shower at your daughter's house currently, right? 
 Patient: Yeah. 
 Nurse: Well, could you detail what difficulties you're encountering or what's hindering you from taking a shower? 
 Patient: And we got one of those chairs. So I don't have to stand up in the tub because that's, you know, not stable on my feet at this point. She has a sprayer but in my situation right now for me to step over the edge of the tub into is just I can't do it. 
 Nurse: I see. So you have a bath chair in the tub and a sprayer already. Your problem is with stepping over the tub's edge, correct? 
 Patient: That's right. Yes. 
 Nurse: All right. There might be multiple solutions to this. For instance, does the bathroom in your daughter's house have grab bars? 
 Patient: No, they don't. They don't have a grab bar here. Okay, grab. 
 Nurse: Grab bars might assist you in moving from your walker to the bath chair. However, considering long-term solutions, if the end goal is to get you back home, I want to inquire about the bathrooms in your house. 
 Patient: I have one that's a little bit larger. It has a tub with a shower. But I also have this smaller guest bathroom that does have a walk in shower. So, so that should be okay for me when I when I get back there. 
 Nurse: Fantastic. You can consider moving the bath chair from your daughter's house to your home. This would ensure that you have a bath chair in your walk-in shower. So, it seems like we're sorted regarding your home. Now, turning our attention to your current living situation in your daughter's house, how are you keeping clean? Are you using wet wipes? Or how are you managing? 
 Patient: I just took a washcloth and put some soap on it and just kind of clean the relevant areas if you know what I mean. But it's not the same as taking a shower. I can tell you that. 
 Nurse: Indeed, a washcloth bath doesn't quite replace a full shower. I have a few suggestions on how we might creatively address this issue to facilitate a safer bathing process for you. Are you open to hearing them? 
 Patient: Yes. Okay. 
 Nurse: Brilliant. The initial idea is to install some grab bars in your daughter's bathroom. We could engage a professional who would assess the bathroom, understand your requirements, and install the bars accordingly. Did you have a physical therapist at your acute rehab facility? 
 Patient: Well, yes, yes, I did. I did have a physical therapist there. 
 Nurse: Perfect. Not only can physical therapists design exercise routines, but they can also conduct a home safety assessment and recommend necessary equipment. This might be useful in the short term while you're at your daughter's house, and also in the long run while planning your return to your home. Maybe we could have the physical therapist visit both locations and provide solutions accordingly. What do you think about that idea? 
 Patient: Yeah, I mean, if I'm I don't know how long I'll be here. I hope it's not too long. I can't imagine that we could get a grab bar here soon enough anyway. And I don't want to mess up her bathroom. 
 Nurse: I understand. However, what do you think hinders your return to your home? What would make you feel safe there? 
 Patient: So what I'd like them to find out is, you know, there's, I've about this walker now, I don't know how long I'll be using that, how long I need that. I don't know, you know, I've got some rugs and things. And I'm just not sure what it would take to be able to navigate safely there. So, you know, I need someone to check that out for me and tell me what needs to be done. 
 Nurse: Absolutely. If you're agreeable, we could arrange for you and your daughter to meet the physical therapist at your home. Is your home reasonably close by? Can your daughter drive you there? 
 Patient: Yes, it's not too far from here. 
 Nurse: That works splendidly. You could begin your interaction with the physical therapist at your home. They'll conduct a home safety assessment, provide advice on changes such as removing certain rugs and other possible hazards, and devise a safety plan. How does that idea strike you? 
 Patient: Okay, well, just in general, how long can I expect that it will take me to to kind of get more mobile and get feeling better so I don't have to use this walker? 
 Nurse: Before getting your new hip, were you relying on a cane or a walker for mobility? 
 Patient: I was using a cane, yeah, I was in quite a bit of pain. 
 Nurse: I see. When you and your surgeon decided on the hip replacement, did they mention that you could hope to walk without pain, without needing a cane? 
 Patient: Well, yes, it's supposed to be like a miracle or something. 
 Nurse: Brilliant, because different surgeons set different post-operative goals. If the expectation is for you to walk painlessly without a cane after the surgery, and you are proactive in your care by adhering to the exercises suggested by the physical therapist, you should expect to resume routine activities in about 12 weeks and a full recovery within six months to a year. During this period, you'll transition from the walker to a cane and eventually attain mobility without any aids. Would that clar 
 Patient: Yes, yes, I didn't realize it would be that long. 
 Nurse: I understand. However, remember that the goal is for you to enjoy pain-free mobility. Hopefully, this enhances the quality of your life, and you might even find yourself chasing after your grandkids. Moving ahead, I will be ordering a physical therapist via a call to your primary care doctor. While we do this, it would be advantageous for you to have someone regularly checking in on you and lending a hand, maybe with groceries or cooking. Would you be open to that during your recovery period? 
 Patient: Oh yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe so. I mean, I hope to get back to cooking. I really am cooking. Absolutely. But I can see that I might need some help for a while just because if you have, even as I know from using a cane, it's hard to carry groceries when you're using the cane. 
 Nurse: Absolutely. Additionally, it might be helpful, especially while bathing, to have an assistant to help you sit on the bath chair safely. This could be another item to consider. 
 Patient: Yeah, yeah. 
 Nurse: So, let's consider this option too. We needn't make all decisions at once, but it could be worth thinking about a possible part-time caregiver. This would not only ensure you have company but also make your daughter feel more at ease. 
 Patient: Yeah, yeah. 
 Nurse: Excellent. Now, I understand that currently you're using a walker. However, are you experiencing any pain? 
 Patient: Well, I do have a little bit of pain if I, especially if I move around, you know, over a certain period of time. 
 Nurse: What about your surgical site, how is it healing? Is it completely healed? 
 Patient: There are still some sutures in there that they said had to come out. I'm not sure when that happens. 
 Nurse: Are they sutures or possibly steri-strips? 
 Patient: Well, I don't really know the difference. 
 Nurse: Do they resemble small skinny tapes, or do they look more like stitches in threads? 
 Patient: Yeah, they said I'd have to go back to the doctor to get this out. 
 Nurse: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you mean they look more like stitches done with thread? 
 Patient: Yes, thread. They said I'd have to go to the doctor to get this out. 
 Nurse: Understood, thank you. And how does the skin around these stitches appear? 
 Patient: Pretty good. I mean, you know, there's a scar there for sure. It's not what you'd expect, kind of purplish, but I don't know. It's nice. 
 Nurse: And is there any discharge or bleeding? 
 Patient: No, not at all. 
 Nurse: That's great. Do you have an appointment to get these stitches removed, or would you like me to get in touch with the surgeon to assist with this? 
 Patient: I don't know. Yesterday was such a, you know, crazy whirlwind kind of day getting out of the rehab and there's a stack of paperwork. My daughter took that. So yeah, I think it's here somewhere, but there may be an appointment in there, but maybe not. 
 Nurse: How about I lend a hand? Since I'll be reaching out to the surgeon for the physical therapist referral, I could check on your stitch removal appointment. Subsequently, I can inform you about the appointment details, saving you the trouble of rummaging through paperwork. 
 Patient: That would be very helpful. Thank you. 
 Nurse: Wonderful. Are there any other concerns or requirements you'd like to discuss right now? We know where we need to begin: a family meeting with your daughter to discuss transitioning you back to your home. Anything else for the time being? 
 Patient: I think that's it. That's it. 
 Nurse: All right. To recap, I will contact your surgeon to inquire about stitch removal and to request a physical therapist referral. I will also reach out to our social work team to explore the possibility of a part-time caregiver for you during your recovery. Is that accurate? 
 Patient: Okay. Yeah. 
 Nurse: Sublime. In your case, prior to our family meeting, it would be beneficial to have a preliminary discussion with your daughter about your return home. Also, can you please inform her about the upcoming appointments and ask her if she is available to drive you to your house?
