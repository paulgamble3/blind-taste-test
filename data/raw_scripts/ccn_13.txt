 Nurse: Excellent, I appreciate your cooperation. As I mentioned earlier, I'm a medical professional affiliated with Walnut Creek Health, calling in relation to your primary care provider. I am given to understand that you've recently left a rehabilitation center following a hip surgery. Therefore, I wanted to check in to see how you're doing and also work towards easing you into the care you require at your daughter's apartment, where it appears you are currently residing. 
 Patient: Yeah, yeah. You know, I love my daughter, but I so, so want to get out of here and get to my own apartment. 
 Nurse: Your motivation to regain your independence is commendable. How are things progressing with your recovery? Were you discharged to your daughter's apartment yesterday, or was it earlier? 
 Patient: It was just yesterday, and we are having trouble here. It's just not really set up all that well for me. 
 Nurse: Could you elaborate on the difficulties you are facing at this moment? Could you provide some details about what's inhibiting your comfort? 
 Patient: I mean, she has a shower stall for one thing. And I haven't had a good bath in ages. It's just hard to get in and out of. Even though it's a stool, there's still a little step to get in. 
 Nurse: This sounds challenging indeed. 
 Patient: It's just rough. You know, I've got this walker thing. It doesn't really work here. It's tight. 
 Nurse: I understand. So, the apartment is somewhat restricted for you to mobilize with the walker, correct? Also, it seems that you're eager to have a comprehensive shower but finding it challenging to access the shower stall due to maneuverability. Have I understood your concerns correctly? 
 Patient: It's a shower stall, but it's a small bathroom and we don't really know what we're doing here. 
 Nurse: I can empathize with your situation, as it can be challenging to adapt to such sudden changes, especially after a hip surgery. However, do not worry, we'll find a solution together. Now let's explore other aspects of your day-to-day life post-hip surgery. How would you rate your pain levels? It seems to me that you've been able to walk around, which is splendid. 
 Patient: I mean, they gave me things to take care of the pain and it seems to be pretty well controlled, but it's just that, you know, I'm not in my own space and it's hard. I just want to get out of here. This is not where I want to be. 
 Nurse: I understand. And we're going to work towards getting you back to your space comfortably. If I may ask, what pain medication are you currently using? 
 Patient: I seem to be doing okay with the Tylenol and they gave me or I had been using so it wasn't really new for me. Capsaicin, I think it's called. 
 Nurse: Yes, Capsaicin is typically used for arthritis. Judging by your files, it seems that you do have a history of arthritis, is that correct? 
 Patient: Yeah, I mean, I had the hip surgery to relieve the pain and yeah, it's rough. I mean, it's a big thing. I'm used to being active and I just don't feel like I'm in a good place right now. 
 Nurse: It’s understandable, feeling out of place because you're not in your usual environment can indeed be unsettling. However, we'll work together to improve your current circumstances. 
 Patient: Yeah. And we don't have. you know, my daughter's trying to help out but we don't have the training really and they tell you stuff at the rehab. but once you get into your own home, it's different or her home. Absolutely. 
 Nurse: You're correct. Adapting to a new environment post-surgery can indeed be challenging. However, you're not alone. We encounter several such cases and it's a common situation. Before we discuss the plan to help you transition home, I would like to inquire about your surgical site. Have you noticed anything unusual about your surgical site? 
 Patient: From what I was told before they released me, they said it's healing well, and I need to arrange for a visit to the primary care to take the stitches out. 
 Nurse: That's spot on. Normally, the orthopedist - the surgeon who performed your operation - would take care of removing the stitches. However, I will double check that information for you. Also, you do have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your orthopedist next week where they'll examine your surgical site and remove the sutures. In the meantime, while you're at home under your daughter's care, it's crucial for you to keep an eye on your surgical site. Whether it's covered with a bandage or exposed to air, the area should be clean and not have any excessive drainage. If you notice symptoms like swelling, redness, or any discharge, please notify your orthopedist or myself immediately to avoid any infection. Also, if the surgical site causes significant discomfort or swelling despite taking Tylenol, please let me know. I will leave my contact details with you before we conclude the call today. 
 Patient: Okay, I prefer to stay away from strong stuff so if the Tylenol is doing the job, let's just stick with that. 
 Nurse: I wholeheartedly concur and am pleased to learn that the Tylenol is serving its purpose. Regarding your post-surgical mobility, it seems the surgery has aided in overcoming your previous hindrances with movement, according to your medical files. 
 Patient: If we can just figure out a way to navigate my home - because I'm hoping to get there soon - that would take a lot off my mind. 
 Nurse: That’s indeed crucial and is one of the main reasons for my call today. As a nurse handling case management, my role includes ensuring you have the necessary support and care resources to aid your recovery process. Our mutual goal is to facilitate your safe and sustainable return home. Let’s further discuss this plan. 
 Patient: It is yes. 
 Nurse: Fantastic. Your doctor has arranged for a home health nurse and a series of physical therapy sessions to aid your recovery process. These will commence tomorrow at your daughter's apartment. Is that alright for you? 
 Patient: No I'd like to get her out of my hair, to be honest with you. It's getting weird with her fussing over me all the time. I'm trying to get home. No, she's insisting on being here, so yeah okay; everything I need. 
 Nurse: It seems like you're in safe hands with your daughter. Arrangements have been made for the therapists to visit your apartment approximately at 10 AM tomorrow. They'll be conducting various checks and setting up the physical therapy regime catering to your requirements. Are you comfortable with this plan? 
 Patient: I can tell her I'm clear on it. 
 Nurse: That's a positive step. Will there be anyone else at the location tomorrow, apart from your daughter? 
 Patient: She'll be there. I cannot get rid of her. 
 Nurse: It sounds like your daughter is dedicated to your recovery. This support can be beneficial during this time. However, I understand your need for independence as well. 
 Patient: She means well, yeah. I'm more of a, I do better on my own. So a week, I can handle if I know there's an end in sight. I can handle it. 
 Nurse: I understand. Now, if I may ask further about your condition, are your health vitals, in particular your blood sugar levels, stable? Also, how are your movements, especially while getting in and out of bed? 
 Patient: Okay, the only thing I've got is high blood pressure. I'm taking the medicine for that. 
 Nurse: Are you currently taking Metformin for your high blood pressure? According to my records, it seems like you also have a machine to monitor diabetes. I need to verify this with your primary care provider. 
 Patient: Yeah, no, just I take amlodipine. I just take one pill once a day for that. It’s okay. 
 Nurse: I see. And are you also taking Vitamin D on a daily basis? 
 Patient: I do take that once a day. That's for my to keep my bones healthy which I guess they're not so healthy after all. 
 Nurse: Well, at times our bodies might need a bit of assistance. Please continue taking the Vitamin D, as it helps strengthen bones and would aid in your recovery from the hip surgery. Now, shall we discuss your physical activities and movements throughout the day? 
 Patient: Yeah, I mean, I was able to do some of my exercises this morning. I could get up and get to the kitchen, sit down on my own pretty much without her. you know, without her help. I know what I'm doing. You know, have a have breakfast have a light breakfast and then you know get up again. I got myself to the bathroom. I, with her help, I got dressed, so I think I'm I'm on the right track here. 
 Nurse: It indeed seems that you're making significant progress. We just have to work towards further improving your mobility and preparing you for a smooth transition back home. As I mentioned before, the home health team, comprising a nurse and physical therapist, will be arriving at your location tomorrow at 10 AM. They'll establish your treatment and rehabilitation schedule based on your condition and recovery rate. Now, is there anything else that would aid in your transition? For instance, meals, caregiver assistance at home, etc? 
 Patient: I think I'm I'm pretty good. I'm only two blocks away from my daughter. okay, we're both in high-rises so there are doormen there are elevators. so it's a pretty good I think a pretty good setup for us. so I know it's gonna be there more than I want her there anyway. oh yeah, I mean, she took off two weeks from work, so I'm hoping you know, oh fantastic okay yeah. 
 Nurse: Excellent, your surroundings seem to be assistive and safety-conscious. The physical therapist will inspect your daughter's house and later your apartment as well to ensure a secure and hazard-free environment. They will provide guidelines on avoiding tripping hazards, managing the stairs, etc, for your home. Can you verify whether you have any stairs to get inside the shower? 
 Patient: Wow, that's it, and then there's a ramp to get in to the building, my daughter's building. Mine doesn't even have a ramp because there's no nothing to ramp up to. It's just straight in from the sidewalk. 
 Nurse: Insightful, I appreciate your thoroughness. Lastly, regarding your medication, it seems you're controlling your blood pressure levels using amlodipine, correct? Also, are you still taking vitamin D daily? 
 Patient: I don't know why it's on you that that must be else because thank goodness that's one thing I've avoided. 
 Nurse: Alright then, healthwise, it seems like you're doing well. If that's all, I'll conclude this call. But before I do, here's my contact information. I'm Vida, spelled as V-I-D-A, and my phone number is 333-444-5555. Feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance.
