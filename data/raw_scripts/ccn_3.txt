 Nurse: Thank you for confirming that. I would like to share my contact number with you in case our call gets dropped, or if you have further questions in the future. My number is 333-444-5555. 
 Patient: All right. 
 Nurse: Good. Now, as I was reviewing your chart, I noticed you have had a recent fall and release from an acute rehab facility. Can you tell me today's date, time, and your own name? 
 Patient: I believe I do, yes. 
 Nurse: Excellent. It indicates here that you're alert and oriented. As per my records, you currently live with your adult son, is that correct? 
 Patient: Yes. 
 Nurse: Perfect. I understand that a caregiver is currently helping you. How's your relationship with them so far? 
 Patient: She's very helpful. I know that maybe I'm not the easiest patient because I just like to do things on my own. So I feel sometimes I might be a little demanding of her. 
 Nurse: So, if I understand correctly, you would prefer to maintain a certain amount of independence and you sometimes find it challenging to accommodate the extra help. Is that correct? 
 Patient: I understand that there are some things that I simply can't do for myself anymore. And it's especially, you know, I can't live on my own anymore. But it is nice to have someone around to help me remember to put in my hearing aid and to help me get my food prepared and that kind of thing. 
 Nurse: I see where you're coming from and acknowledge the importance of maintaining independence. Our goal here is to provide the necessary support and aid while retaining your independence. The caregiver is here to assist with essential tasks such as bathing, grooming, mobility, and meal preparation. I see here that you're on a pureed diet. Is that correct? 
 Patient: I'm sorry. Oh, yes. 
 Nurse: All right. Can I assist in better preparing these pureed foods? 
 Patient: Yes, I need help blending the foods because I can't really eat too many solid foods. But yes, I need to talk to my son because he has a blender that I can't figure out. and usually the aid leaves. He chops up all the fruits and vegetables and she puts it in the blender and she leaves and then I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 
 Nurse: I see. It sounds like you might benefit from additional help, particularly around meal times. Would it be helpful if the doctor referred additional support to assist you once the caregiver leaves? Our primary concern is ensuring you're able to have your meals properly. Can you feed yourself if the food is appropriately prepared? 
 Patient: Yes. 
 Nurse: Excellent. If both you and your son consent, I can initiate a referral for additional help at no extra cost. They would come five days a week after the first aid leaves and assist with meal preparation, ensuring your diet is prepared to your liking. Is this acceptable to you? 
 Patient: I just want someone to help me with this blender. 
 Nurse: Understood. So you want assistance with understanding your blender while still maintaining your autonomy in food preparation. Does that summarize your needs correctly? 
 Patient: Right. And also, I really don't like to have the aide come in when I need a shower. I don't like, you know, I'm a private person and I get very annoyed because she always wants to be with me when I'm getting in and out of the shower. 
 Nurse: It sounds as if your privacy is very important to you. Was the purpose of the aide's presence during your showers explained to you? 
 Patient: Well, I understand why she's there. It's to keep me from falling again. Keep me from falling again. But I do miss having my privacy because before this incident I was living alone. And especially it's an adjustment to have someone who I frankly I don't know very well, who's with me in these moments that are very private for me. 
 Nurse: I appreciate your sentiments and understand your concerns about privacy. If I may inquire, your showers typically involve standing, correct? 
 Patient: Yes. Well, my son installed grab bars for me to hold in the shower and next to the toilet. 
 Nurse: I see. The caregiver is present to ensure safety while bathing. To maintain your privacy and safety during showers, I suggest introducing a shower chair. In that way, you can comfortably bathe without feeling invaded, and the caregiver can ensure your safety from the door. I would also propose that an occupational therapist assess your home for additional safety measures such as non-slip rugs. What are your thoughts on this? 
 Patient: Yes. Yes. 
 Nurse: Splendid. I will begin referring the OT and a home health aide. Can I assist you with any other concerns or services? 
 Patient: I'm hello. 
 Nurse: Yes, I'm here. 
 Patient: I'm thinking. I'm thinking. If there's anything. Well, I do have a, I have these referrals from my doctor. 
 Nurse: Of course. 
 Patient: And, and I don't know how to, how to see these people. There, I know that there was a physical therapist. And I believe another kind of therapist. Is that something that you can help me with? 
 Nurse: Yes, indeed. The occupational therapist will be one of the professionals visiting. I was also planning to set up an appointment with a physical therapist who can assist with enhancing your strength, coordination, and mobility. Regarding bathroom use, have you experienced any difficulty getting there without soiling your pads? 
 Patient: Well, it depends on the day. I've had some, some accidents and, and that was another reason that they, they, they wanted to bring in an aide because she is helping me with that. 
 Nurse: So, the aide is aiding in keeping you dry, correct? 
 Patient: Yes. 
 Nurse: Good to know. Frequent changing of pads is important to prevent UTI and other infections. Along with the OT and physical therapist, a home health aide will also come assist you to maintain nutritional balance and promote independence with dietary choices. You're doing an excellent job maintaining your health and it's my priority to support you in your independence. 
 Patient: Well, I'm trying. I'm trying my best. 
 Nurse: That's the spirit. Is there anything else you require assistance with? 
 Patient: Well, not that I can think of right now. 
 Nurse: Excellent. It has been a pleasure assisting you. You can expect some calls soon to arrange the appointments we discussed. Does that sound acceptable?
