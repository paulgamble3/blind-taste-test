 Nurse: Hello, Jane. I'm David King, your nurse care manager from Walnut Creek Health. Is now a good time to discuss your health matters? 
 Patient: Yes, yes. Thanks for returning my call. 
 Nurse: Splendid. To proceed, I need to validate your full name and date of birth. Can you provide me with those details? 
 Patient: Yeah, sure. Jane Doe, birthday, June 8th, 2001. 
 Nurse: Thanks for the confirmation, Jane. I'm getting in touch to arrange an appointment for your flu vaccination. 
 Patient: Yeah, I called and left a message. I just wanted to be sure I should get the flu vaccine. I've recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. And you know, so my immune system isn't what it used to be now. And I'm just a little worried about getting it. I'm worried about getting the flu and I'm worried about getting the flu shot. So I was calling to just get a little advice on what I should do. 
 Nurse: I appreciate your diligence in addressing this concern. Can you tell me about your current health status? This would help us decide whether it's the right time for you to get the flu shot. 
 Patient: Um, well, I feel pretty good. I mean, this has been quite a shock because I'm, you know, I was pretty healthy. And now I've, I've got this and, you know, my kids are in high school and they're busy with activities, you know, you know, dance and sports and just, you know, all kinds of things and yeah. Of course it's very inconvenient for me to have breast cancer and I'm trying to, trying to keep, be lighthearted about it, just, you know, to keep, keep, keep my spirits up. But, um, right now I feel okay. So I just, I'm, I'm getting ready to start chemo here. So I'm very nervous about that. And next week, and then the doctor wants me to get the flu shot next week. And I don't know what I should be doing. And so that's why I called and left a message. 
 Nurse: I admire your openness and your proactive approach toward your health. Jane, it is usually recommended by the CDC that cancer patients take the flu shot, as this lowers their risk of severe complications from the flu. It's good to know your family's already getting vaccinated, especially because they're often around you. This will reduce the chance of them transmitting flu to you. 
 Patient: Yeah, they always get it. 
 Nurse: That's reassuring to hear. In the meanwhile, how are you coping emotionally with your current situation? 
 Patient: Just really nervous, honestly. They feel like they caught this fairly early. So I'm going to get end of this week. I'm going to get another MRI. And then the plan is next week for a little bit of chemo to shrink the tumor. And then we're going to talk about surgery, but it might be flip flopped. It might be the opposite. I might do the surgery first and, you know, and then do chemo. So we're going to see this MRI will probably be a pretty, pretty big deal. So I'm right now. my biggest problem is I'm just really nervous and honestly trying not to talk about it with my kids. I'm not, I'm trying to make them nervous. I know this sounds really dumb, but you know, it's soccer tournaments time right now. And my son is in soccer and I just want him to be able to enjoy, you know, these last few games. He's a senior this year, and I don't want this to overshadow any of that. So I'm really just trying to just be nervous with me and my husband and not involve them in it right now. Although I know, you know, they're pretty, they're pretty nervous too. 
 Nurse: It's certainly not "dumb" to protect your children from stress. Your empathy underneath these challenging circumstances is admirable. Speaking with like-minded individuals through support groups might be beneficial to you, offering you a safe platform to let out your apprehensions. Also, we have support groups designed for families of cancer patients. Could this be of interest to you? 
 Patient: Well, I haven't survived yet. 
 Nurse: I understand. Yet, it's crucial to remain positive. You're in the heat of the battle and I fully believe in your ability to come out victorious. 
 Patient: Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the offer. I really just, my focus is on end of the week, getting through this MRI. So I'd like to reach back out to the office to talk to you or the doctor about, you know, something like that if I feel like I need it after the MRI, just to kind of help me through whatever the next step is, whether it's just chemo or whether there will be, you know, surgery. So after those results. 
 Nurse: Absolutely, I respect your decision. Since you mentioned feeling nervous, do you feel that some form of anxiety relief, perhaps a medication, could be of help to you? 
 Patient: No, I don't want to take anything else right now. I think I'm going to have to, I'm going to get the flu shot and I'm going to have chemo. That seems like a lot of medicine and I'm not taking any. So we'll just see how I do with this MRI and go from there. 
 Nurse: I understand your perspective. In addition, I would like to send you an email with the CDC's guidelines on flu vaccination and crucial information about cancer. Would you be open to this? 
 Patient: Yeah, that would be great. 
 Nurse: Fantastic. I will arrange that for you. Additionally, I will provide you with my direct line, so you can reach me if you have more questions or concerns. 
 Patient: Okay, go for it. 
 Nurse: The number is area code 333-444-5555. 
 Patient: Okay. 
 Nurse: Expect the email shortly. Let's also schedule your flu shot, ideally for next Monday. Does that suit you? 
 Patient: Monday is a really good day before two o'clock if possible. 
 Nurse: Understood. I will arrange it and get back to you with the confirmed timing.
