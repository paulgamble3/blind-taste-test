Patient: Will I be able to workafter the procedure,
System: If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.
Nurse: Yes, you should be able to return to work after the procedure, assuming you feel well and alert.However, you'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure because you may be sedated.Do you have someone who can do that for you?
Patient: I have arranged for a ride home.How long after do you think I'll be able to return to work?
Nurse: Great, it's important to have a plan for getting home after the procedure.As for returning to work, it usually depends on how you're feeling and the nature of your job.If you have a desk job that doesn't require much physical activity, you might be able to return the same day.However, if your job requires more physical effort, you might need to take it easy for a day or two.It's critical to listen to your body and not rush back to work if you're not feeling ready.
