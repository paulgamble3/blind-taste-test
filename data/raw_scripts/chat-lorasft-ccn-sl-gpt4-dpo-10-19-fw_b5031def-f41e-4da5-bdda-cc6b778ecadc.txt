Patient: Unless at all, it's it's just really hard toknow what I'm allowed to eat.
Nurse: I understand that it can be difficult to know what you can and can't eat with your conditions.It might be helpful to speak with a dietitian who specializes in renal and PKU diets.They can provide you with a personalized meal plan and help you understand what foods are allowed and which ones you should avoid.Would you like me to arrange a consultation with a dietitian for you?

Nurse: I'm glad you're planning a trip to Houston!While I don't have specific restaurant recommendations, I can suggest a few ways to find healthy options.You might want to look for restaurants that offer meals that are low in salt and fat.Many restaurants now list nutritional information on their menus, which can help you make a choice.Additionally, you could consider looking up restaurants that specialize in healthy or organic food.Does that help?
